### Kaggle open call projects (3 points)

[Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/) is a data science website that hosts open call projects, datasets, data science competitions, code, and more.

1. Create an account with [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/) and sign in.
1. Explore the Kaggle [competitions page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions), which maintains a list of open call projects. Describe one that is of interest to you. What is the goal of the competition? What would you have to do to make a submission?
1. Explore the available datasets on the Kaggle [datasets page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). Download one of the datasets and generate a descriptive plot that highlights some instructive characteristic of the data. Make sure your plot has a title, labeled axes and axis titles, and a legend if necessary. Submit your script (`.R` or `py`) and your plot (saved as a PDF). Make sure your script is properly commented and reproducible.

### Improving a journal article (3 points)

Look through a recent issue of a journal in your field. Find a paper that you think could have been reformualted as a human computation project. How would you formulate the data collection as a human computation project? How might this improve the study?

### Amazon Mechanical Turk (4 points)

Many human computation projects rely on participants from [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome). Sign up to become a worker on Amazon MTurk by clicking the "sign in as a worker" link in the upper-right corner of the home page. Spend one hour working there in some HITs (Human Intelligence Tasks). Show evidence of your hour of work by attaching a screenshot of your "Your Account" page and your "Qualifications" page.

#### Alternative assignment: InfluenzaNet (4 points)

If you are unable to create a worker account on Amazon MTurk, you can complete this alternative assignment.

In the InfluenzaNet project a volunteer panel of people report the incidence, prevalence, and health seeking behavior related to influenza-like-illness (ILI) ([Tilston et al. 2010](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-10-650); [Noort et al. 2015](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436515000638?via%3Dihub)).

1. Compare and contrast the design, costs, and likely errors in InfluenzaNet, Google Flu Trends, and traditional influenza tracking systems.
1. Consider an unsettled time, such as the swine flu outbreak. Describe the possible errors in each system.
