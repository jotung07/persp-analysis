## Evaluating research designs

* [Edelman, B. G., & Luca, M. (2014). Digital discrimination: The case of airbnb.com. *Harvard Business School NOM Unit Working Paper*, (14-054).](articles/digital-discrimination-airbnb-2014.pdf)
* [Edelman, B., Luca, M., & Svirsky, D. (2017). Racial discrimination in the sharing economy: Evidence from a field experiment. *American Economic Journal: Applied Economics*, 9(2), 1-22.](articles/digital-discrimination-airbnb-2017.pdf)

In the above papers, the authors apply computational social scientific methods to assess the occurrence and impact of digital discrimination in the marketplace, specifically Airbnb. For each paper:

* **(3 pts each)** Summarize the research design and explain how the research design leverages computational methods to ask and answer a question.
* **(4 pts each)** Evaluate the effectiveness of each paper's research design **independently**. That is to say, what do we learn from each paper on its own? What are the limitations of each paper on its own? Think back to Salganik's characteristics of big data and our assessment of experiments' validity, heterogeneity of treatment effects, and causal mechanisms. Draw on these methods of assessment as you evaluate the effectiveness of each paper.

Having evaluated both papers independently, now link them together through the following tasks:

* **(3 pts)** Identify the value-added of conducting both research projects. That is, what do we learn from running both an observational study **and** a field experiment that we could not learn from just one of these methods?
* **(3 pts)** Consider how you could apply a digital survey-based research design to the primary question of interest from these two papers. What are the potential drawbacks to a survey approach? How might you overcome these drawbacks?

#### Can I collaborate with other students on this assignment?

**No.** Unlike the standard homework assignments, you are not permitted to work with other students on this assignment. Your submission should be entirely your own work. You may use the textbook, your notes, and other existing resources as necessary to complete the exam, but you may not work with other people on this assignment. If you have any questions, direct them to a member of the instructional staff.

#### How long should our papers be?

They should be **complete**. Take the amount of time and space you feel necessary to communicate your response.

## Submitting your assignment
