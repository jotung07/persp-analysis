# Proposing an Observational Study
## Kris Nichols


As more polls continue to reveal that the majority of American citizens support governmental intervention in limiting carbon output, social scientists have sought to discover what then creates the discrepancy between these polls’ results and election results [SOURCES](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/03/21/climate/how-americans-think-about-climate-change-in-six-maps.html)[SOURCES](http://chicagotonight.wttw.com/2017/10/12/uchicago-poll-most-americans-want-government-address-climate-change). With this job usually falling to psychologists, many studies have emerged utilizing self-report measures of: skepticism towards science, emotional reactions towards climate change, the nearness with which they perceive problems induced by climate change, and others to reveal underlying mechanisms that may inoculate individuals against stronger beliefs in climate change [SOURCES](https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/4757/WIRE%20ClimateChange%20Perceptions%20Weber.pdf)[SOURCES](http://scholarship.law.gwu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1298&context=faculty_publications). However, with the fickle way in which participants answer surveys – whether it be on account of reactance, framing effects, observer-expectancy bias (when a participant may feel pressure to yield a certain result and acts accordingly), and several other biases – these studies should be taken with a measure of doubt. They rely on artificial and inaccessible means of expression to, question why participants feel so distant from the issue, and this could easily hamper their results.  
	
Taking a computational approach – specifically a natural experiment approach - which measures participant’s real-time, organic responses to variables, is much preferred to truly reveal mechanisms of why people continue to doubt the effects and veracity of climate change. Furthermore, as the central focus of research has been to investigate how and why participants perceive the repercussions of climate change as distal, I believe the more important question is how individuals change their belief in climate change when they are confronted with these effects [SOURCES](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21553954). In order to do so, I propose research in which Google search results regarding climate change are measured in states which have experienced the largest, average discrepancy between normal seasonal temperatures and seasonal temperatures over the past five years.   

I believe that this design harnesses two aspects of big data research which provides leverage that classic survey research simply does not have – resistance to reactivity and robust longitudinal data. 
Resistance to reactivity caused by participants being unaware of data collection is especially pivotal in this area of research since it is theorized that aversiveness to science could be a primary motivator of disbelief in climate change. If participants are already aversive to science and are pressured into answering a certain way in a study, it is very likely that they will react artificially and skew the results of the study. To truly capture the mechanisms of how individuals are interacting with information on climate change when confronted with its repercussions, organic measures are needed, something achieved in excess by Google search data. The internet is the second most common place where Americans receive their news, and Google is overwhelmingly the most popular search engine – if someone’s feelings about climate change fluctuate after abnormal temperatures and they want to learn more (or learn why they should not worry), these patterns should emerge here [SOURCE](http://www.journalism.org/2016/07/07/pathways-to-news/). And herein lies another great advantage of big data, that no matter when these temperature changes - and the subsequent Google trends -  arise, this data can be recorded. This style of data collection is hugely beneficial compared to survey research in which data can only be collected in the exact moment that the participant is present, or with great effort over very sporadic instances. This “always-on” quality is incredibly advantageous for this area of research as it allows for analysis of longitudinal data from potentially many years ago, allowing for more patterns to emerge. For example, if a normal experimental design were used to measure participants’ in February of 2017 these opinions would likely be highly polarized due to the recent election of Donald Trump, and this bias would make the actual effects of the variable indistinguishable. However, with the advantages of natural experimentation and big data, the data long before and long after this rare occurrence could be analyzed and used to help understand the mechanisms, other than the IV, at work in the study. Lastly, an advantage of this approach is the immense size of possible data. While most survey research may be limited to college students who often times lean liberal, these large data can be more externally valid, as they are more likely to include many different demographics. 

While this is a sizable improvement over average sampling methods for survey research, the dataset is still biased in some ways and possibly non-representative. For example, people who are younger are more likely to use the internet, and this could affect the population that is sampled for the research. Also, potentially confounding the results could be the states in which these temperature discrepancies emerge. For example, if the three states with the largest temperature discrepancies are all in the south, the sample may be biased by data from states that are more likely to be strictly conservatives. This potentially gives a biased perspective of how the variable affects climate change beliefs, and the ability to assume causality could be weakened. 

Adding a matching component to the design can help control for these errors. One advantageous matching design would be to select three different states (not sure if this should be a colon), one state that is historically conservative, one that is historically liberal, and one that is a swing state, each with the highest temperature discrepancy in its respective group. Then use three more states for the matched pair, with these states representing the lowest temperature discrepancy in their respective group (i.e., temperatures closest to normal across the seasons). This matched pair would result in an experimental group of the three states with the lowest and highest temperature discrepancy for better comparison and easer analysis. Other possible matching variables that would help reduce covariates include the number of natural disasters that have occurred and the prevalence of fossil fuels as a part of the economy. 

Although this alteration to the design of the study helps to control for some of the negative characteristics of big data, there are still other issues, such as incompleteness, that may hamper the strength of the study. It could be argued that the way in which individuals interact with information about climate change or politics regarding climate change is not sufficiently expressed through Google searches, and this is a fair criticism. This issue may be solved by making a slight tweak in design and incorporating more measures. By including data from Twitter and Facebook, the study is able to form a more complete idea of how individuals express themselves politically and provide exciting new avenues of analysis, including likes, retweets, and shared posts regarding climate change. Limitations of this change include concerns over its dirtiness and inaccessibility. However, this research would prove beneficial for both companies as it would shed light on the use of both platforms as tools for consuming politics in addition to political activism. It would also strengthen both platforms’ identity as tools for connecting individuals in the wake of changes that alter ways of life. 

Although there exist numerous hurdles to achieving a strong design that avoids the pitfalls of big data research, this study capitalizes on the strengths of the approach in such a way that the potential gains in knowledge outweigh the drawbacks. This study would leverage the benefits of “always-on” and non-reactive data collection to capitalize on data that would add a perspective not yet achieved in the field of psychology in its attitudes towards attitudes towards climate change.
