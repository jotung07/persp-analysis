Proposing an experiment


Introduction:

Education and how to improve the quality of education is of great importance to the society and have become the attention of many researches today. In specific, many ongoing researches focus on the effects of using media in teaching. Sharing the similar research interest, this paper intends to discover how does using media in teaching influence the academic performance of college students in the U.S.  A digital field experiment will be conducted. 


Significance:

The research will provide teachers, professors, and any other people working in education with insights about how to utilize media to enhance teaching and learning. In specific, this research will allow people to realize the effects of media, in the forms of music, reading recordings, a documentary or movie clip in class. With this knowledge, scientists may discover new efficient way for learning in compatible with brain functioning, and traditional classes may be combined with new methods to raise students’ academic interests and hence enhance their performance as a result.


Experiment Design:

In order to find experiment subjects, I will randomly choose five different Universities in fifty different states in the U.S. This way my sample would be very diverse across different areas. Increasing the demographical differences among treatments could potentially reduce sampling error in my study. 

Furthermore, I will randomly choose five classes in those Universities. The classes must be chosen from the following five different disciplines: social science (such as psychology, sociology and etc.), literature (could be any country’s literature or languages or writing classes and etc.), nature science (such as physics, mathematics and etc.), engineering (such as chemical engineering and etc.), and art. 

I will begin the recruitment by approaching professors in those chosen classes in the chosen Universities. This contact could be done either in person or using electronic devices. I will tell them the importance of this study and appreciate their help in this experiment. All the process will be kept in dark for the students. 

In this experiment, two groups are involved. The treatment group will be randomly chosen, and it will be one session of class taught by the professor. In the treatment group, a form of media will be used in class while teaching. For example, it could be one of the following: playing music about the studying material, a movie clip relevant to the course, or a documentary or video related to the class. On the other hand, the control group will be another session of the same class taught by the professor. Or if that that professor does not have more than one session of the same class in a semester, it will be the same class in another semester or quarter or even in second year. 

After confirming the experiment is finished, the academic records of all the involved classes will be collected digitally. The grades of those students will be used to compare the difference between the treatment and the control group. And to find out if there is significant impact of using media in teaching. 


Discussion:

This experiment design combines the traditional field experiment with digital methods. In specific, the recruitment process, randomization, outcome measures could be done entirely electronically. The Universities and classes are randomly generated by computer randomization algorithm, and professors can be contacted using phone calls or video calls. The results of the academic performances are reflected in letter or scale grades, which can be analyzed digitally. 

The experiment itself or the treatment delivery process happens in the actual academic field- the classroom. Students have no knowledge that they are involved in an experiment, they will simply assume the media format is just a tool the professor usually use to teach. In this way, the students will perform the same behavior with or without the media in the class, and hence the difference between treatment and control subjects themselves is very small.

Also, the media format is carefully chosen and the contents of the media will be cautiously scrutinized to avoid any unhealthy or negative contents that may result in undesirable academic performance. And the media format and contents across different Universities are controlled to be very similar. This way the average treatment effect could be potentially reduced. 

Since highly representative samples are chosen randomly, the processes of the experiment are carefully designed, the treatment errors are deliberately reduced, the validity of the experiment is very high. 

In the statistical analysis, different statistical models will be used to draw conclusions around this experiment. Confidence level, p-value, or other enhanced statistics will be used to evaluate whether the result of media is statistically significant. And multilevel analysis will be done. For example, if the general conclusion is no influence, we will look closely at more detailed level of the sample results. Are there any boomerang effects within the treatment groups, are there opposite effects canceling out each other in different disciplines, or are there different influences across different media format or different regions and etc. 

In consistence with its significance, this study is also highly applicable to the education world in general. This experiment is done in college, but it can also be performed very similar in high school, middle school, primary school or even kindergarten using the same methods and design. These further studies could be highly informative and revolutionary for learning and studying purposes. 

Furthermore, if researchers and scientists are interested in particular how each media format influence teaching and learning, or when and where to use the media has the best effect on learning, they can use my study as a ground stone to build up more studies using similar designs and technique. 

Compared to the traditionally analog experiment, this digitally enhanced design has every beneficial characteristic related to digital design. Firstly, the cost is trivial if everything is done digitally, Small amount of financial reward could be used to stimulate the professors and schools’ interest to participate in the experiment. Secondly, the scale could easily go much larger if choosing more schools and more classes. And the later processes will still be kept similar. 


Potential problems:

Ethics is one of the main concerns of my experiment. Delivering intervention to the treatment potentially disturb the original plans of the professors. It may affect the progress of a class. What’s more, a positive effect of media in teaching would be ideal, but if there are undesirable effects, the school will blame my experiments and the previously good intention of this experiment will bring opposite results. 

Besides ethical concerns, some difficulties might rise within the experimental process. 
It is not easy to control the media format and contents to be same across different classes and different Universities. Maybe some subtle varieties would bring different and unexpected experimental results. This could be potentially disturbing to our findings in the end. 

There might be the case that in some Universities, the professor i choose is not familiar with media teaching. In this case, I may need to spend extra time and money to train the professor. Or if the professor does not inform me with the situation, and uses his or her own method instead, this could potentially tamper my experiment results. 

Also, as I mentioned briefly in the discussion, the statistical analysis part could be tricky. Diverse and complicated models and statistical methods need to be used to handle the situation of boomerang effect, and potential opposite effects within the treatment groups.
