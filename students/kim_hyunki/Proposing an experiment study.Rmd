Online soccer game as an experiment to test game theory

Hyun Ki Kim

The purpose of this research is to find out whether change in scope of a critical information cause the individual’s behavior to change.

This experiment design builds on from my previous observational study and survey study proposal. My research goal was to verify the existence of directional biases in a high stake decision such as a penalty shootout in a major tournament. In the observational study, I proposed that professional soccer players might choose the side where their subjective probability of success is highest. If there exists such a bias, it is likely that the subjective probability will be correlated to previous success rates for the player. Furthermore, I proposed a gamification survey of a penalty shootout to simulate the behavior of soccer players in the survey study proposal. Even facing with the uniform randomly behaving computerized goalkeeper, users might have a preferring side based on their previous success rates.

In this experiment study, I would like to modify the user vs. computer setting of the game to a user vs. user, to better simulate an actual penalty shootout. For the participants of the experiment, I will invite top 5% scoring users of the same game I proposed for the survey study proposal, to a ranking tournament at the end of each month. Although marginal cost of inviting more users to a tournament is negligible due to the digitally enhanced aspect of the game, I want to limit the number of participants to maintain the importance of the tournament. Also, inviting only top 5% of the user would be helpful for the study because it can assumed that they fully understood the game and are highly motivated in participating in the game just like professional soccer players in a major tournament.

First goal of implementing this experiment of online tournament is to find out the effect of change from user vs. computer situation to user vs. user situation. In theory, user should feel indifferent between having a computer goalkeeper and having other users being goalkeeper because they should both make decision at random. However, when we are confronted with a user goalkeeper instead of computer, the decision may get more complicated. We human are bad at choosing at random. Our brain has evolved to behave in a way that reinforces good outcome and avoids bad outcome. Therefore, it is likely that human goalkeeper will make decisions that are different from computer goalkeepers that are programmed to behave serially independently. One thing I was amazed after learning computer programming was that even computer cannot produce a “pure random”. Therefore, when we are faced with a human goalkeeper that behaves less “random”, our decision-making process could change to better off.

However, actual goal of this experiment is not finding the behavioral difference between facing a computer goalkeeper and human goalkeeper. What I want to find out is that how does the user’s behavior change from the situation where their preferences was being kept secret to themselves vs. the situation where their preferences is being open to other player. In a real world penalty shootout, even when kicker has a preferring side, what prevents him from kicking more to the preferring side is the fact that goalkeeper may also know about the information. For example, let’s assume that Ronaldinho, a professional soccer player prefers kicking to left side to center and right sides due to his previous experiences. However, the fact that goalkeeper also knows this information might affect Ronaldinho not to choose the left side. But again, the fact that Ronaldinho knows that goalkeeper also knows that he prefers left might affect goalkeeper not to choose the left side, suggesting Ronaldinho to kick to the left. This recursive thought process is the factor that motivates players to choose mixed strategy in a game theory situation. Therefore, I want to verify that user makes more uniformly random decision when their preferences are revealed to other player.

I will run the monthly online tournament for several month and wait until the participants of the game to be stabilized. I don’t want to give treatment when the number of user of the game is fluctuating because the true casual relationship can be found only when the other factors except the controlling factor stay the same. Then I will randomly choose one month of users in the tournament as a control group of the experiment. The setting for the tournament game is very similar to the simulation game, but the game is now played online with anonymized users instead, and the users are motivated by rankings instead of cyber money. Also, the users receive information about their previous success rates for all their previous shots but do not have access to the information of opponent user.

After recording behavior of the control group, I will randomly choose another month and set it as a treatment group. The treatment is revealing opponent player’s success rates for each direction. Null hypothesis is that user’s frequency of choosing every side remains same compared to when the user goalkeeper didn’t know about kicker’s previous records. Alternative hypothesis is that the frequency of choosing each side is not the same as when the previous records were kept secret. I will use the difference in mean hypothesis testing to find out whether the mean of proportion chosen preferring side (in this case, the side that had the highest success rate) between control group and treatment group differs.

If I fail to reject the null hypothesis, it is likely the case where the users are equally randomizing the directions despite of the fact that the other user think kicker prefers one side or not. However, if there is a statistically significant difference between control group and treatment group and I reject the null hypothesis, it is likely the case where leakage of seemingly irrelevant information causing changes in kicker’s decision. Moreover, I am guessing that if I reject the null hypothesis, the reason would be coming from the tendency to choose between preferring side vs. others, changing the underlying choice from initially choosing from three options (left, center, and right) to choosing from two options (preferring side vs. other sides). If this turns out to be the result of the study, it is possible to apply to the real world penalty shootout situation. For example, before the penalty shootout the goalkeeper can tell the kicker what his guess is in order to manipulate the distribution of directions. However, I am not fully convinced how just revealing the knowledge of preferences would motivate other player’s decision to change.

Strength of this experiment design again comes from the digital aspect of the study. When the game is properly set up for the survey study, connecting two users is not too difficult. Also, by implementing the game on social network service such as in Facebook, I can easily recruit many participants for the experiments. Finally, the participants not being aware of participating in an experiment will rule out many biases that might occur in a research. The weakness of the study is that making an online game, and making it popular is not an easy task. It requires lots of financial, technical support and it is time-consuming task as well. Also, casual online game user’s behavior and the professional soccer player’s highly concerned decision may be very different. However, when the experiment is properly set up and implemented, it could reveal the hidden secret of a penalty shootout.
