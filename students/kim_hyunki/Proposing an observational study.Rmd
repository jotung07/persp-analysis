Preconscious Decision Making in a Penalty Shootout

Hyun Ki Kim

The purpose of this research is to find out whether a professional soccer players have directional bias in a penalty shootout. Although the best strategy in a penalty kick is to randomize direction, it is tempting to kick the ball to more comfortable side when facing stressful situation.

Introduction

Average 2.78 goals are made in a soccer game and it is one of the lowest scoring sports. However, penalty kick is one situation in soccer match where probability of scoring increases dramatically. Penalty kick is given when defending team makes a foul in a penalty area, which is near the goal line. When penalty kick is given, all players except the kicker and the goalkeeper must be 10 yards behind the ball. Given such a low scoring nature of soccer, the importance of penalty kick in soccer is higher than any other penalty kick/throw in other sports. Another circumstance where we see penalty kick is in a penalty shootout. During a tournament matches where winner and loser of the match have to be determined, game is extended for 30 minutes when the games are tied after an ordinary 90 minutes match. However, if the scores are still tied after the extra time, each team shoots 5 penalty kicks, which is called a penalty shootout and decides winner and loser of the match.

Success rate for penalty shootout is slightly lower than that of a penalty kick during a regular match, and there are two explanations for this phenomenon. First, unlike basketball where the player who received a foul needs to throw a free throw shot, anyone in the team can kick the penalty kick in soccer. Therefore, player who has most confidence for penalty kick takes a shot in a penalty kick. However in a penalty shootout, kicker must be different for all shots the team makes, and therefore less experienced, less confident players also kicks in a penalty shootout. Also, not all shots in a regular penalty kick is important as some shots are taken in a situation where the result of the match is virtually decided. However, a single kick in a penalty shootout always has huge impact on not only the match itself but also for the tournaments that are prepared for whole season.

In order to answer whether professional players have bias in a highly stressful situation, I first need to find out if comfortable side exists for soccer players using player’s individual past penalty kick record. I can simply count the frequency of directions each player’s have selected, but it would probably not reveal their secret preference because players have incentive to randomize the directions in the long run. Therefore, more sophisticated function that takes the importance of a situation into account is needed to truly measure the comfortable side and its intensity. This could include the score difference of the time of a shot, and the importance of a match along with many others. Also, the recent missed or saved information must be taken into account, since it is likely to affect player’s decision when selecting a direction.

Previous researches showed that professional kickers and goalkeepers are in fact good at randomizing their decision using Mixed-Strategy Nash Equilibria (Chiappori et al., 2002; Palacios-Huerta, 2003). However, some researchers have found there exists bias during a penalty kick. Goalkeepers tend to dive more to the sides when it is better to stay more in the center (Bar-Eli et al., 2007). The reason for this is because goalkeepers want to show that they are at least trying something to avoid blames. For the kickers, they can better off by kicking to the upper area of the goal (Bar-Eli and Azar, 2009). However, the kickers prefer to kick to the bottom area and get saved by goalkeepers rather than trying to kick to the upper area and miss the shot to the air. Therefore, it is possible that players randomize their decision in the long run but have biases in a certain situation.

Several percentage points increase in predicting kick direction might seem meaningless to a non-soccer fan because goalkeepers cannot save all the shot even when they chose the correct direction. However in some matches such as in the UEFA Champions League Final, winning and loosing in a penalty shootout worth millions of dollars. Not only it is important in terms of economic value, but winning in a tournament such as the FIFA World Cup has long term effect on pride and brand power of the nation as well. Therefore, decision that players make in a penalty shootout should not be treated lightly, but careful analysis is necessary to improve the decision they make.

Data

Unlike survey data or experiment data where people are asked how they would behave in a certain situation, penalty kick direction is a real world data that reveals players deliberate choice. Although it would not be possible to collect all the penalty kick history of a player since their early career, some websites such as https://www.transfermarkt.com provides data including success/failure, match name, date, final result, and the goalkeeper for most of the top tier league around the world. If I can add direction data from broadcast videos, it would be enough to reveal the secret behavior of professional soccer players during a tournament penalty shootout.

Bigness of the dataset is especially helpful in analyzing rare events such as penalty kicks. I am trying to detect directional preference that each soccer player has. One might argue that professional soccer players are trained well enough to feel each side equally confident. However, they would still have mental account that can contrast one side having a better chance over other sides based on their previous experience. Keeping track of entire soccer match in top tier leagues might seem overwhelming, but penalty kick is such a rare event that not many soccer players in a league have experienced more than 30 penalty kick attempts. Therefore, if it were not for the bigness of the data in the first place, it would not be even possible to test the hypothesis and detect the small differences.

However, there are several drawbacks of the dataset that I am aware of. Firstly, the dataset could be incomplete. In theory, it is best to collect the direction information from all the kicks made by the player, but most of the kicks would have not been recorded. Secondly, the dataset is likely to be dirty. In many cases in a penalty kick it is hard to clearly distinguish kicks into left, center, or right. The dataset is also dirty in the sense that they not in organized form. It is very difficult to backtrack all the penalty kicks that a soccer player have made and find the direction of the kick, especially for the penalty kicks from years ago. Lastly, the behavior of a soccer player could have been drifting overtime. Researchers have suggested several strategies for a penalty kick in last two decades. If the coaches or the players were aware of these studies, it is likely that it had affected their decision-making process overtime. Furthermore, if the research hypothesis of soccer players having biased preference in a penalty shootout is confirmed, it will have such a huge impact on decisions onward, which might cause the research not to be reproducible anymore.
