## Research Questions

Customer behavior, which is known as the psychology of marketing, helps companies to improve their products and marketing strategies by studying the psychology of customer experience. Understanding customer behavior is not only about understanding customers' past experience, but more importantly, it also predicts the future. Amazon is one of the largest internet-based retailers in the world, which provides us with a good platform to study customer behavior. In this assignment, my research question is to predict what kind of customers will be more likely to purchase products from a certain category (which I will define later) again on Amazon. There are many categories of products on Amazon, so here in this study I will specify and restrict the categories of product that I will analyze because for some categories, such as musical instruments, it's not necessary for customers to purchase again periodically. For this study, I will analyze products that are in the categories of beauty, clothing accessories, grocery & gourmet food, health & personal care, office product, handmade and home. Also, since Amazon has separate retail websites for countries all over the world, in this study, I will only consider the Amazon website for the United States. Customer analytics lies at the core of marketing, so the research question in this assignment may serve to provide marketers with some critical customer insights.

## Source of Data and Data Collection

The data in this study will involve two parts. The first part is the survey data, and the second part is about customers’ order histories, which will be gathered from the Amazon database.

## Plan

I am going to use the digitally-enhanced survey to approach this research question. In this study, I plan to study first-time buyers of different categories of products starting from January 2016 because by tracking the buying patterns of first-time buyers, we can have a more precise insight into how their customer experiences about specific product shape their buying patterns and behaviors. After choosing the sampling population, I will gain consent from participants and ask for permissions to get access to their order histories. Since the customers’ experience towards a product may be changing, to capture the dynamics during this process, participants will be asked to complete the survey every two months for one year. The survey will be sent to customers’ emails and can be completed by computers or mobile phones. Then by tracking the order histories of the participants in the study, those who have purchased again at least once within the one-year period will be marked with a dummy variable 1, and those who have not purchased again will be marked with a dummy variable 0. I will then analyze the correlation between the survey data and the digital data that I collected from Amazon. I separate the data by the categories of the product and analyze the correlation within each category to predict what kind of customer will be more likely to repurchase this category of product. I plan to use multiple regression analysis with time series to analyze the correlation between multiple variables and the dummy variable as well as the dynamics (how the customer satisfaction changes) within the one-year period to conclude what kind of customer will be more likely to purchase a certain category of products again.


## Basic Survey design

The survey will contain two parts. The first part of the survey will be demographic information such as age group, gender, and location. The second part of the survey will be about customer satisfaction related to the products they bought. The following sample questions come from online resources. 
Some sample questions will include:
1. On a scale from 0 to 10, how likely are you to recommend our product to others?
2. On a scale from 0 to 10, how well does our product meet your needs?
3. On a scale from 0 to 10, how would you rate your overall customer experience?
4. On a scale from 0 to 10, how likely are you to buy again from us?


## What about the survey makes it digitally-enhanced?

Ecological momentary assessments will be used in this digitally-enhanced survey study. First, the collection of data is in the real-world environment. Second, the survey is aimed at getting access to the recent states and experiences of the customer. Third, the assessments involved in the survey is event-based and time-based because customers’ experiences about products are dynamically changing due to different time stages and events associated with the products. Finally, the survey will be given every two months for a whole year so that I can get multiple assessments over time to better analyze the consistency or inconsistency of customer experience and customer satisfaction (Stone and Shiffman 1994). 

Another distinct characteristic that makes the survey study digitally-enhanced is that the survey is linked to other big data sources to produce estimates and inferences (Salganik, 2017). More specifically in this study, I will link the survey data with some observational data about the order histories of customers to produce inferences on multiple variables. 

## Survey Study vs. Observational Study and the Strength of Using Survey Study

In the observational study, my research question was whether Amazon product ratings could predict a company’s stock price. In the study, I observed and recorded the customer ratings of the products. For this study, it is also feasible to be conducted in an observational way. We can observe customers’ buying patterns by observing the product ratings they have given and tracking whether they will buy again in the future. However, comparing to survey study, the data gathered from observational study will be mostly incomplete because typically, roughly about 15% customers on Amazon leave feedbacks and rate on their experience, so if we want to observe the buying patterns of customers who leave feedbacks and rate on products, the sample population will deviate from our population of interest. Compared to the observational study, survey study is more appropriate for this research question. First of all, the survey method studies the first-time buys of products from a particular category, so the sample population will be more comprehensive than that in the observational study. Second customers who gave feedbacks on Amazon may change their opinions about the products after they have rated and given feedbacks, so merely concluding from observation data will lack the transition of these dynamics. However, by using digitally-enhanced survey study, we can access the dynamics of the attitudes of customer behaviors by the periodic surveys.

## Weakness

The first kind of error we may encounter in this survey study is representation error. Our target population is all the customers of Amazon products in the categories we defined above in the first section. However, in this study, I studied the first-time buyers of products starting from January 2016 that fall into those categories. The resulting representation error may result in sample selection bias, and my sample may not be representative of the whole population. Also, non-response error will also affect the result of our study because not all the sample population will respond to our survey.

The second type of error that often appears in survey study is measurement error. Since measurement error can depend on the way I ask questions in the survey (Salganik, 2017), I plan to study some customer satisfaction surveys that have been used for years and quote from these surveys to minimize the measurement error.
