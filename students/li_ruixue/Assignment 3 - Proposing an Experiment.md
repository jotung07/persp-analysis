## Research Question

How is liberal sex education related to the consumption of feminine hygiene and sex products?

## Introduction

In my previous proposal of a survey study, I've looked at what's the current landscape of sex education and awareness on related topics among Chinese reproductive-age females, and how is it related to their reproductive health and consumption of feminine goods, because it's becoming much more acceptable to discuss sex in China over the past few years and the market for feminine hygiene and sex products has also experienced exponential growth. (36kr.com 2017) While surveys are particularly useful in understanding our population's past sex education and their awareness, they were less conclusive in discovering the causal mechanism between sex education and consumption of related goods because of the possible confounders such as personal income. Therefore, I propose to run an experiment to uncover this link, and more specifically, I'd like to look at whether more liberal and feminist sex education will cause females to increase their consumption in goods that improve their own sexual health and sexual life. 

## Plan for Conducting Digital Experiment

### Platform

Same as in myproposal for a survey study, I plan to use a Chinese mobile app called DayimaLittle Period Helper, which is a mobile application that provides menstrualperiod tracking function for women as the platform for conducting theexperiment. Dayima also offers tailored and targeted advertisements,interaction functions like forum and voting, and it sells its own selection offeminine hygiene and sex products. (Crunchbase 2017)

As of the firsthalf of year 2017, the number of registered users on Dayima has reached 120million, with over 55 million active users each month, which is 8% of thefemale population of China, assuming that the number of male users isnegligible for the sake of argument. (Countrymeters2017) Therefore, it will bean ideal platform for recruiting a large number of participants. 

We can relativelysafely assume that the company would be onboard with this experiment since theresults of this study should be able to help them improve their content toincrease revenue. Currently, the content available on this app focuses on advertisementsof their products, tips on improving feminine health, and occasional lovestories, while other important topics in modern sex education and feminism suchas emotional relations and responsibilities, human sexual anatomy, consent, andreproductive rights, are largely missing. If we find that broader more liberal sexeducation has a causal relationship with consumption of certain goods, thecompany will have incentive to put more educational content on their app inorder to increase sales. Moreover, liberal sex education is a slowly growingtrend in China and is welcomed by the general public. Therefore, we'll faceminimal amount of opposition from the company or the users, and we could expectthe company to be cooperative in providing data and platform.

### Running the experiment

I'll discuss my experiment plan in the following four steps: 

#### Recruitment of participants

In this experiment, we don't need to go out of our way to recruit extra participants other than the app's users. Since pushing contents to users is already a function of the app, as long as we keep our tailored to the social and legal environment in China, I don't think that we'll face too many issues with consent or ethics.

#### Randomization of treatment

The users are going to be assigned into treatment group and control group randomly. Since the app collects demographic information of its users, we could confirm whether our assignment is random by checking whether the two groups are comparable in terms of demographics.

#### Delivery of treatment
The content of the treatment will be articles, videos, comics, or other form of sex education materials published in the app or push to the users. We need to take care to ensure that we're not creating direct advertisements, but focusing more on delivering knowledge and ideas. Meanwhile, since we're interested in the effect of liberal sex educations, our content will be liberal and promote feminism. Nevertheless, we don't need to and shouldn't produce the content from scratch since the researchers are not necessarily experts in the area of gender and sexuality. We could make use of the existing contents produced and posted online by sex education professional or academics. Of course, we need to take proper steps to avoid copyright infringement while doing so. 

While the control group receives nothing more than the regular contents on the app, we could further divide the treatment group into smaller sub-groups and vary the topics and frequency of our treatment, in order to gain more insights into whether exposure to certain topics is more likely to increase consumption, or whether the frequency matters. 

#### Measurement of outcomes

The consumption of feminine hygiene and sex products will be measured by users' purchases in the app's marketplace. To measure the treatment effect, I'd like to use a mixture of between-subjects and within-subjects design: we'll measure the pre-treatment and post-treatment consumption within a certain period (we could look at both short and long-term effects by using one short and one long period) for both the control and treatment groups, and calculate their difference-in-difference of consumption. 


## Discussion on Research Design

### Benefits of running digital experiment and comparison with survey

Running this experiment digitally not only allows us to administer treatment to a large group of participants and measure the outcome relatively easily, but also lowers the cost. In fact, the variable cost of this experiment is almost zero since once we've designed the experiment and produced the treatment content, there's no extra cost associated with distributing the content to participants. 

Compared with the survey studies I've proposed earlier, where the link between sex education and consumption was observed through respondents' answers to survey questions and in-app purchases, we can be more confident in identifying the causal relationship here. However, since experiments can't be used to study events in the past, one of the questions that I tried to answer by the survey study, which is what's the sex education that the users have already received, could not be studied by running experiment.

### Heterogeneity of treatment effects

We could potentially look at heterogeneity of treatment effects by grouping the participants according to demographic characteristics such as age or marital status. For example, while it's possible that younger users are more receptive of new knowledge and more likely to change their consumption habits, older users might have more disposable incomes. Therefore, it could be interesting to see whether sex education work differently for different user groups. 

### Causal mechanisms

We could gain some insights into the causal mechanism by more detailed collection and analysis of data. For example, we can identify relevance between certain topics and certain products, such as birth control and conceptrative products, and see whether there's a temporal correlation between the publication of the topic on the app and the sales of the product. 

### Validity

I'll discuss the validity of this research from the following aspects: 

#### Statistical conclusion validity

The statistical conclusion validity of this study need to be guaranteed by making sure that the difference-in-difference estimator is calculated correctly.

#### Internal validity

To perform the experiment correctly, we'll need to ensure that our assignment of treatment and control groups is truly random to rule out the effect of confounders such as income. Running this experiment digitally helps in this aspect since we could easily gather and compare the demographic information of the two groups. Digital experiment also allows us to accurately administer the treatment and measure outcome. Though one concern is that not every user in the treatment group will actually read our content, but this situation actually resembles what's happening in real life where not all the people who are provided sex education actually receive it, and it will only bias out findings towards finding less effect. However, we do need to be cautious in interpreting our results.
Another issue we need to take note is creating the content, since what's considered liberal sex education is a local and subjective standard. We could keep our content relevant to local social environment and avoid being too liberal, and therefore running into ethical issues, by obtaining our content from those that are at the frontier of sex education and related academic fields in China instead of in the west.  

#### Construct validity

As with other digital experiments, the construct validity is probably the most challenged validity in this experiment, mainly because the users' purchase in the app is not a perfect measurement of their consumption on feminine hygiene or sex products, as they could also purchase those products offline or in other online marketplace. Therefore, we need to keep in mind that the results are probably biased towards zero as the effects could be dispersed to other consumption channels. We could potentially mitigate this problem by incorporating surveys asking users about their consumptions outside of the app, but that's likely to be imperfect as well due to the issues such as inaccurate reporting. 

#### External validity

Since sex education makes people become aware of the needs for certain products in general, I would expect that it to hold true in other countries as well, especially developing countries where the consumers are still less educated. If similar digital platform exists elsewhere, this experiment could be replicated and the external validity could be verified. 

In conclusion, while the specific research I'm focusing on for digital experiment is slightly different from the survey study, they are compliment to each other and both are able to provides insights into the area of sex education and consumption of feminine hygiene and sex products.
