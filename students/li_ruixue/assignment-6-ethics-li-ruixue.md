## Assignment 6 - The ethics of the Montana election experiment

## Li Ruixue

### 1. Assess this study using Salganik's four principles of ethical research.

I'm going to argue that the ethics of this study are questionable from the following aspects:

#### 1. Respect for persons

As cited from the Belmont Report by Salganik in Bit by Bit [(Salganik 2017)](http://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/ethics/ethics-activities/ ), the principle of Respect for Persons can be adhered by (1) treating individuals as autonomous and (2) providing additional protections to individuals with diminished autonomy, which in practice is usually expressed in the form of informed consent.

However, this study did not obtain informed consent from the participants. The recipients of the mailers, who are in the treatment group of the study, were not informed of this study in any way prior to the study. They also did not have any chance to opt out since the mailers were sent in the form of postcards, so the selected participants had no choice but to receive the information printed on the mailers the moment they saw that piece of paper. Should there not be complaints and controversies that came up later, it seems that the researchers didn't plan to ever debrief the participants on what had happened, which is understandable because telling people that their voting behaviors had been manipulated by university professors was unlikely to make you popular. Actually, the fact that deception - possibly without later revelation - was needed itself should have sounded the ethical alarm to the researchers. 

Though indeed, according to Salganik, when informed consent compromises research goals, which is likely to happen in this case, the researchers may not be able to receive informed consent. However, I think that the researchers hadn't given enough effort to finding alternative solutions, which do exist and will be discussed in the last part of this essay.

   #### 2. Beneficence

According to the Belmont Report [(Salganik 2017)](http://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/ethics/ethics-activities/ ), to observe the principle of Beneficence, the researchers need to (1) do not harm and (2) maximize possible benefits and minimize possible harms. However, we can hardly argue that this study did not violate this principle should it be allowed to carry out as it was designed. 

The most obvious and severe harm would be the potential alteration of the election results. Since the study intended to study voter turnout, it inevitably has the possibility of changing the number of votes, and in an election, sometimes even one more voter could make a difference in the outcome. In addition to affecting those who wouldn't have voted, people who would have voted regardless of the treatment may also vote differently now that they are told more about the candidates' political positions. Therefore, all the voters in Montana would be harmed now that their election was no longer fair, especially those who voted for the candidate who lost since that candidate might have won without this intervention from the researchers. Since the Montana Supreme Court Justices will make important decisions that affect the life of the Montanans, the possibility of harm is real and its magnitude could be quite significant.

The researchers also failed to conduct a solid risk/benefit analysis, which will be discussed later. It's also hard to say that they've made a sound decision given the potential benefits and risks, considering that they didn't go through a proper IRB review process, which was put in place exactly to prevent potential harms to the participants.

#### 3. Justice

This study didn't do perfectly in the justice aspect either since the burdens and benefits of the research weren't distributed fairly and evenly.

While it can be argued that the study could help the political scientists gain better understanding of the democratic process and therefore suggest improvements on the institutions and voting practices, therefore benefiting all Americans and even the rest the world, the burdens fall disproportionally onto the Montanans, especially the voters of the candidate that lost, since they were the only ones whose lives were in most danger of being changed to the worse by a different election outcome. 

The government of Montana also took some of the burdens, since the Great Seal of the State of Montana was used without their permission and they received complaints from voters, whose trust in the government might have been affected. Besides, the researchers were the only people who will definitely benefit from this research, making the research more ethically shaky. 

#### 4. Respect for law and public interest
This is another principle that this study failed to obey since (1) they failed to comply with existing laws and rules and (2) they weren't making the goals and methods of the research quite clear, not even to their respective IRBs prior to running the experiments.  

The commissioner of political practices of the state of Montana, Jonathan R. Motl, has concluded that the flyers constituted an independent expenditure in the Montana elections, making them fall under the requirement of registration, reporting, and disclosure specified by the Montana campaign practice laws, which the researchers failed to comply with [(Motl 2017)](http://politicalpractices.mt.gov/Portals/144/2recentdecisions/McCullochvStanfordandDartmouthFinalDecision.pdf). She also referred this matter to the County Attorney for review regarding the unauthorized use of the Great Seal of the State of Montana. Though in my opinion, since the failure of registration, reporting, and disclosure do not sound like the central issue in this matter, it seems that the commissioner might also be somewhat at lost as to how to hold the researchers and the universities accountable. But she also couldn't completely let the researchers go without any blame since the study had clearly disrespected the public interest, so she resorted to pinpoint at least one aspect that she could build the most solid case upon. Though the universities later disagreed with this ruling, nevertheless, the researchers could have avoided coming so close to being prosecuted with some methods that I'll discuss in the end. 

At the same time, since the research involved human subjects, the researchers should've followed proper IRB procedures, which they didn't. 

Though as Johnson pointed out [(Johnson 2017)](http://politicalpractices.mt.gov/Portals/144/2recentdecisions/McCullochvStanfordandDartmouthFinalDecision.pdf), the IRB may not have prevented this incident from happening since the procedures were not well-suited for political science studies, the backlashes from the public and the academic community may be less severe should they at least attempted to address the potential ethical issues prior to running such a large-scale experiment. 

In sum, the Montana election experiment did not obey any of the four ethical principles quite well. 

### 2. Assume that the mailers were sent to a random sample of voters: under what conditions might this mailing have altered the outcome of the Supreme Court Justice election?

If the assignment of participants into the treatment group was completely random, the outcome of the Supreme Court Justice election might be altered if the mailers encouraged or discouraged, and changed enough votes. There may be one or more mechanisms at work, including but not limited to (1) supporters of one party, for example, the Republicans, may be more susceptible to the (seemingly) partisan information than the other party as the researchers expected, (2) one demographic group may be affected more, for example, the young people who were more likely to be liberals and who couldn't be bothered to vote, voted after seeing the mailers, biasing the election outcome in favor of the Democrats. 

At the same time, the random error itself may very well alter the election outcome, if it happened to be large enough, the likelihood of which was low but not zero.

### 3. Does the non-random sampling of voters change your assessment of the research design? If so, how?

By doing non-random sampling in the specified way, the researchers were trying not to alter the election result by aiding the candidate that was already likely to win. In this case, I would at least give the researchers more credits for engaging in some activities that aimed at minimizing the potential risks, showing that they were acting according to the beneficence principle. However, the effect of the treatment was uncertain. On top of the conditions discussed in the previous question, in this case, if the hypothesis were wrong and the voter turnout was actually be negatively affected by the flyers, the treatment may have caused the leading candidate to lose more votes. In fact, targeting voters in this way was exactly one factor that commissioner Motl considered in deciding that the study was against Montana election practice laws. Therefore, those the researchers made an attempt to reduce their disturbance in the election, their approach may not have been very effective. 

### 4. Does the researchers' way of choosing the races change my assessment of the research? 

Similar to the previous question, my assessment of this study would be slightly improved since they tried to comply with the beneficence principle. However, this still couldn't rule out the possibility that the election outcome was affected given the unpredictable nature of elections and human behaviors in general. Moreover, as pointed out by Johnson [(Johnson 2017)](http://politicalpractices.mt.gov/Portals/144/2recentdecisions/McCullochvStanfordandDartmouthFinalDecision.pdf), there were some other events going on at that time and it was entirely probable that the winners of the primary were different from the winners of the general elections in the end. Therefore, the researchers' assumption that the winners of the primary would win again in November was too strong, and it wasn't sufficient to change the fact that the study was ethically flawed. 

### 5. Does the election results change your assessment of the research? If so, how?

After seeing the results, I think that means that if the researchers were not called out on the ethical issues related with this research and they were able to complete it, they might have been able to avoid the worst case scenario which was changing the election result. However, this doesn't change the fact that there was a possibility before the election happened that their treatment might alter the result. Just like we can't use the fact that a person didn't die after being shot to justify the act of firing shots at a person, the election results also couldn't be used to justify the research design and therefore my assessment is not changed. 

### 6. Does the fact that the principal investigator is the co-founder of CrowdPAC change my assessment of the research?

Yes, I think that the said principal investigator has personal interests in this research. For example, if the research found that information of candidates' political position, calculated in the same way as his company did, had a significant impact on voter turnout, he could use this finding as a sales pitch, thus increasing his personal gain. This exacerbates the violation of the justice principle, and potentially violates some more laws and rules regarding conflict of interests. 

### 7. What, if anything, would you have done differently if you were the principal investigators? How would you have designed the study if you were interested in exploring whether additional information increases voter turnout in nonpartisan races?

#### (1) I would obtain some form of consent.

Even though I may not want to give a full disclosure of the purpose of the study to the participants in advance in order to avoid Hawthorne effect, I could be creative in finding alternatives. For example, I would probably include the actual political position of the candidates in an envelope that explicitly states that the enclosed materials were part of a research study, related to the upcoming election but not intended to be partisan, that the recipients probably would not benefit from reading it, and that they could choose not to open the envelope with no consequence.

#### (2) I'd be more careful in designing the flyer. 

For example, I would not use the seal without authorization, and I'll state in obvious place how the scores were calculated and their limited degree of truthfulness. 

#### (3) I would follow proper procedures and engage professionals to make sure that I'm not breaking any laws or regulations. 

This is really not too much to ask in a research like this, since an election is a serious and highly regulated process that has very real impact on many people's lives. Submitting a detailed and updated proposal for IRB review is a must, and I would seek legal opinions from lawyers who specialize in election practice laws. I'll also disclose my research plan in advance to government officials and make sure that they give the green light before proceeding with the experiment. 

#### (4) I may also make more fundamental changes to my research design as long as I can achieve my research goals.

Since the research goal was to study the effect of more information, and not necessarily partisan information, I may also consider the option of providing more factual and less controversial information such as the candidates' past experiences instead of political positions. 

I'll also conduct more statistical analysis to determine what's the minimum number of voters I need to involve in order to minimize the potential harm of this study on the society.



Overall, there are many ways in which this study could be made more ethical while still preserving its ability to answer the research question in a real-world setting.
