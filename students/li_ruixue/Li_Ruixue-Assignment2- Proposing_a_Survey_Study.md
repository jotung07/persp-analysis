## Research Question

What's the current landscape of sex educationand awareness among Chinese reproductive-age females, and how is it related totheir reproductive health and consumption of related goods?


## Introduction

While sex has not yet totally shaken off itsimage as a taboo topic in China, it's certainly become much more acceptable todiscuss it over the past few years. The market for feminine hygiene and sexproducts has also experienced exponential growth, with the online purchasesgrowing 30-50% over the past two years. (36kr.com 2017) Does this phenomenonmean that the Chinese women are getting more educated and becoming more awarein sex-related topics?

So far, academic institutions and businesseshave conducted some research on awareness of certain topics regarding sex andreproductive health. However, studying the relationship between people's levelof knowledge in this area and their health condition or consumption has beendifficult with traditional survey methods since collection of detailed data inall of the areas above is costly. Therefore, I propose to use digital-enhancedsurvey methods to further the research in this field. The general topic I careabout is what's the current landscape of sex education and awareness among Chinesereproductive-age females. And I think that this research will be more useful tothe public health policy makers and the private sector if we also try to findanswers to questions such as how the education and awareness affect females'reproductive health and consumption of related goods. 


## Digitally-Enhanced Survey Plan

### Data Source

I plan to use a Chinese mobile app calledDayima Little Period Helper as my main source of data and platform forconducting the survey. Dayima is a mobile application that provides menstrualperiod tracking function for women. In addition, Dayima also offers tailoredand targeted tips to help users improve feminine health, interaction functionslike forum and voting, and it sells its own selection of feminine hygiene andsex products. (Crunchbase 2017)

As of the first half of year 2017, the numberof registered users on Dayima has reached 120 million, with over 55 millionactive users each month, which is 8% of the female population of China,assuming that the number of male users is negligible for the sake of argument. (Countrymeters2017) Therefore, it will be an effective method of gathering big data. (36kr.com2017) 

Also, Dayima will be interested in knowing howeducated and aware their users are in the areas of reproductive health and sex,since they could make use of this knowledge to improve their content and targettheir advertisements. Dayima is already active in the area of feminine research.In fact, they have been cooperating with CBNData, a commercial data companyaffiliated with Alibaba, to publish reports on feminine health and consumptionsfor four consecutive years. (36kr.com 2017) Therefore, I would expect them tobe cooperative in providing data.

### Survey Method and Content

There are many ways to conduct surveys via theapp. The survey could be:
- incorporated as part of some articlespublished on the app or pushed to users
- posted in forums by users like in facebookgroups
- part of the user experience survey afterusers purchase products from the app

Since a large number of active users regularlycheck out the articles, discuss in user groups, and purchase products in theapp, we could expect a reasonably large number of respondents. 

Besides, if our budget allows, give-aways orlucky draws of coupons for future purchases inside the app's marketplace couldbe used as incentives to encourage user response. Similar strategies have beenused in the app, and the company is likely to agree to such a campaign since itwill help boost their sales

Many questions could be asked in the surveys,but in general, since the app already collects detailed information aboutusers' demographics, menstrual periods, sex life, health and consumption, thequestions we need to ask are those that are impossible to observe, i.e. theirexperience with sex education and how they perceive certain topics. Example ofthe questions could be when, where, and how they received sex education, andthe topics that they were taught. We could ask these questions through a wikisurvey where we provide a few initial choices and allow users to choose and addtheir own answers. To gauge awareness on certain feminine topics, we could addsmall pieces of surveys to articles and product pages on the platform. Forexample, since there are still many misconceptions about tampons among youngChinese females, we can put small quizzes about them under the page where theyare sold, and use some discount coupons as incentives to entice the users tocomplete the surveys. Furthermore, we could also make longer quizzes intomini-games where users will obtain a score for their level of knowledge aftercompleting the survey, and they could share the quizzes in the app or via othersocial networking apps to invite their friends compete with them. The quizzescould even make a positive social impact by serving as a form of sex educationitself at the same time. 

## Data Analysis

Once data on users' education experiences andawareness of feminine and sex related topics are collected, it can be combinedwith digital traces to draw insights. For example, since the app keeps track ofusers' self-reported health status and sexual life, we can look at therelationship between level of sex education and feminine health or sexualactivities. We can also explore whether better sex education is associated withmore consumption on feminine hygiene products. The mathematical models usedcould be drawn from the field of economics where the effect of education onhealth and consumption has already been studies intensively.


## Discussion on Research Design

### What makes it digitally-enhanced?

Not only the survey is administered via a mobileapp, it employs some methods of asking questions that are only achievable digitally.

The questions we intend to ask could be dividedinto small questionnaires and incorporated into users' daily activities in theapp such as reading articles or browsing products. Nevertheless, I don't thinkEMA is called for in this research even if we may want to look at things suchas the situation of sex education in different parts of China, since it's verycommon for young people to receive higher education and work in a differentplace than where they receive primary and secondary education. 

Wiki surveys, which can be only done digitally,will be used to capture the information that we couldn't think of beforehand,since questions such as what have been taught in your primary school sex educationwill likely differ significantly from place to place. In addition, gamifyingthe quizzes into a fun competition among friends is also a practical optionsince this kind of quiz competition has been present on social networking appsin China for some time, and people will do it without any difficulties. 

Another feature of this research design thatmakes it digitally enhanced is that we intend to link the survey to otherinformation users record in this app, including longitudinal health andlifestyle data, which makes it into an amplified asking process that uses thealways-on characteristic of big data. 

### Why a survey instead of observational study?

Since we are interested in users' educationalexperiences and knowledge on certain topics, which are all attributes onlyknown to the users themselves, surveys are essential in finding out the answers.With observational data only, we may still be able to study certain questionssuch as the relationship between users' health and consumption of femininegoods, but combined with survey data, a lot more social issues could bestudied. 

### Potential sources of error and how to minimize them

The first source of error is representationerror. Though the app has a very large group of active users and smart phonesare already very prevalent in China, the social-economical status of users islikely to be biased towards the highly educated and wealthier, as that's thegroup of Chinese females who are likely to care enough about their health to usean app, thus coverage error is created. Also, users who answer the surveys maytend to have certain characteristic, such as being more concerned about thesetopics we study. If we're going to make inferences on the rest of the users whodid not answer the survey, and on the rest of female population in China, we'llneed to use statistical methods to adjust our estimates. Fortunately, thedemographic data collected by the app and in our survey will help us ingrouping respondents. For example, if we want to know what's the average agethat Chinese women started receiving sex education, we could control thesampling process by making sure we obtain enough responses in each provincesand each age or income group, and use post-stratification to compute estimatesof the whole country. 

Another source of error will be measurementerror, since we're studying the internal states of the respondents, the answersare likely to depend on how the questions are framed. Besides, basic conceptssuch as what constitutes sex education may also differ from person to person.To minimize this error, I think that a pre-test could be beneficial. 


## Conclusion

All in all, I believe that this research willbe a good example of using digitally-enhanced survey methods, and will be ameaningful project since it will produce insights on important social issues.
