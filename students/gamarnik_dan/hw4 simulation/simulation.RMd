## Setting up the simulation for the problems. 

```{r simulation set up}

set.seed(123)

# Using a function to create the simulation parameters. 

inc_ <- function(n_year, s_year, n_sample,
                         inc0, mu, sde, p, g){

# Geenerating the errors within equation using a matrix. 

 error_ln <- t(matrix(rnorm(n_sample * n_year, mean = mu, sd = sde), 
                     nrow = n_year))
 
# Generating formula for year, logged income and errors.
  
  inc_ln <- matrix(nrow = n_sample, ncol = n_year)

  for(i in 2 : n_year){
      inc_ln[, i] <- (1 - p) * (log(inc0) + g * (i - 1)) +
        p * inc_ln[, i - 1] + error_ln[, i]
  }

# Making the data readable for simulation so that  the plots work.  
  year <- c(s_year : (s_year + n_year - 1)) %>%
    as.tibble() %>%
    rename(year = value)
  
  inc_sim4 <- inc_ln %>%
    t() %>%
    as.tibble() %>%
    bind_cols(year) %>%
    gather(ID, inc_ln, 1 : n_sample) %>%

## Question 1.

```{r Q1}

set.seed(123)


# Generating the data. 

inc_sim4 <- inc_(n_year = 40, s_year = 2019, n_sample = 10000, 
                       inc0 = 80000, mu = 0, sde = 0.1, p = 0.2, g = 0.03)

# Graphing

inc_sim4 %>%
  filter(ID == "V123") %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, inc)) +
  geom_line(color = "red") +
  geom_point(alpha = 1/3, color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Incomes from 2019 to 2058", x = "Year", y = "Income") + 
  theme_minimal()

```

## Question 2.

### Those making <$70,000 and >$100,000

In 2019, around 8.94% of people make less than $70,000 and around 1.24% make over $100,000. 

```{r Q2, problems}

set.seed(123)

# Filter the year of 2019.

inc2019 <- inc_sim4 %>%
  filter(year == 2019)

# Getting percents for the two incomes.

income_70 <- percent(nrow(filter(inc2019, inc < 70000)) / nrow(inc2019), d = 2)
income_70

income_100 <- percent(nrow(filter(inc2019, inc > 100000)) / nrow(inc2019), d = 2)
income_100

```

### Bell Curve Distrobution

In 2019, the data has an almost perfect normal/bell curve distrobution. 

```{r Q2, distrobution}

set.seed(123)

# Generating histrogram 
  
ggplot(inc2019, aes(inc)) +
  scale_y_continuous(label = scales::percent) +
  scale_x_continuous() +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), bins = 50, 
                 fill = "purple", color = "black") +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = mean(inc2019$inc), sd = sd(inc2019$inc))) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Income in 2019", x = "Income", y = "Percents") +
  theme_minimal()


```

## Question 3.

Approximately 18.00% of people could pay off their debts by 2028.

```{r Q3, debt}

set.seed(123)

# Generating data to later calculate those who pay off the debt.

debt_95k <- inc_sim4 %>%
  group_by(ID) %>%
  mutate(debt_95k = cumsum(0.1 * inc)) %>%
  filter(debt_95k >= 95000) %>%
  group_by(ID) %>%
  filter(debt_95k == min(debt_95k))

# Calculating how many people paid their loans before 2028.

debt_success <- percent(nrow(filter(debt_95k, year < 2029)) / nrow(debt_95k), d = 2)
debt_success

# Graphing

ggplot(debt_95k, aes(year, ..density..)) +
geom_histogram(bins = 3, fill = "green", color = "black") +
scale_y_continuous(label = scales::percent) +
labs(title = "Distribution of When People Pay Their Loans", x = "Year", y = "Percent Paying") +
theme_minimal()
```


## Question 4.

Roughly 70.35% of the people were able to pay their debts back by 2028.

```{r Q4, debt}

set.seed(123)

# Chaning data to account for the changes in distrobution.

debt_10 <- inc_(n_year = 40, s_year = 2019, n_sample = 10000, 
                       inc0 = 85000, mu = 0, sde = 0.15, p = 0.2, g = 0.03)


debt_95k_10 <- debt_10 %>%
  group_by(ID) %>%
  mutate(debt_95k_10 = cumsum(0.1 * inc)) %>%
  filter(debt_95k_10 >= 95000) %>%
  group_by(ID) %>%
  filter(debt_95k_10 == min(debt_95k_10))


# Calculating how many people paid their loans before 2028 with new distrobution.

debt_success_10 <- percent(nrow(filter(debt_95k_10, year < 2029)) / nrow(debt_95k_10), d = 2)
debt_success_10



# Graphing

ggplot(debt_95k_10, aes(year, ..density..)) +
geom_histogram(bins = 5, fill = "red", color = "black") +
scale_y_continuous(label = scales::percent) +
labs(title = "Distribution of When People Pay Their Loans", x = "Year", y = "Percent Paying") +
theme_minimal()  


```
