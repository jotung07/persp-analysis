### Question 1
Four principles that can guide researchers facing ethical uncertainty are: Respect for Persons, Beneficence, Justice, and Respect for Law and Public Interest (Salganik, 2017). 

#### Respect for Persons
The researchers of the Montana election experiment did not comply with the Respect for Persons. Respect for persons is about treating people as autonomous and honoring their wishes (Salganik, 2017). First, there is no evidence that the participants of this experiment were presented with relevant information. Instead they just received the mailer and felt confused. Second, the participants had no chance to express their voluntaries to participate – that is, the researchers did not receive informed consent from participants, which means they did not treat people as autonomous. Even though the researchers might be worried that to inform the participants could compromise the scientific value of the study, they could have informed the participants after the experiment ended. Some people may contend that this experiment was unlikely to harm the participants, but as research ethicists emphasize, violating people’s autonomy arise even in the case of completely benign studies. Another alternative is that the researchers could seek consent from a third-party such as the government or the committee in charge of the election.

#### Beneficence
The Beneficence principle requires researchers to first conduct a risk/benefit analysis to minimize risks and maximize benefits. In the Montanan Election experiment, the researchers might have done harm to both participants and non-participants and social systems. First, the experiment had adverse effects on the Montana voters’ daily life. It is mentioned that the mailers induced unnecessary confusion among those who received the mailers. We can reasonably infer that apart from confusion, the mailers also might have brought anxiety, suspicion and other negative feelings to the voters. The voters expressed their concerns and complaints, which occupied their time that could have been spent on doing other things. Second, the study hurt the fairness of the election system by providing information to voters unequally. Some voters might be encouraged by more information to vote (as the study hypothesized), or they might change their choices. As a result, this inequality might change the outcomes of the election. Third, as the mailers contained information about parties and political ideology, it ruined the purpose of the non-partisan election.

As for the benefits, the study offered more information to some voters that helped them vote with more consideration. Furthermore, if the study did find something essential to enhance people’s willingness to vote, the whole nation and the people could benefit from it.

#### Justice
As the Belmont Report says, the principle of Justice addresses the distribution of the burdens and benefits of research. As mentioned in the part above, the Montanan election experiment aimed to explore the way of enhancing turnouts. The potential scientific achievement can benefit the whole nation in the long term. However, the burdens of serving as research subjects fell on the participants and Montanan who would be influenced by the election outcome in the long run. Moreover, it is injustice that if the those who received the mailers benefit from the extra information, while others did not. Besides, if the distribution of the participants was uneven, say most of them were Republican voters, the outcomes of the election might be altered in favor of the Republican Party since more Republicans were encouraged by the mailers to vote, based on the hypothesis that voters who are given more information are more likely to vote. Furthermore, the principle of Justice also involves appropriate compensation for participants. Based on the information provided, the researcher did not provide any compensation to the participants. That is, the research was not aligned with the principle of Justice. 

#### Respect for Law and Public Interest
As Jonathan Motl, Commissioner of Political Practices of the State of Montana said, “researchers violated Montana campaign practice laws requiring registration, reporting and disclosure of independent expenditures." It seems like this study failed to obey the relevant laws, which is the first component the Respect for Law and Public Interest principle. Even though the universities sent a letter to apologize and clarified the non-partisanship and independence of the research under the pressure of the formal complaint by the government, they failed to revealed their concern about its legality in advance. 

Transparency-based Accountability is the second component of the principle. The research breached this rule as it did not disclose its study to the public and relevant parties such as the Montana government. What is worse, the researchers used the Great Seal of Montana state without authority, which implied that they not only kept their study secret to the government, but also deceived the voters by pretending to be authority. 

### Question 2
Although random sampling reduces potential uneven distribution of the participants and makes the research more ethical, there are at least two circumstances under which the outcome of the election might be changed by this mailing. 

First, if the mailers offered information in favor of a certain candidate unintentionally, and that more voters were encouraged to vote by the mailers, this candidate would probably receive more votes and thus the outcome would be changed. 

Second, the outcome could be altered if the hypothesis that “voters who are given more information are more likely to vote” is true, but the effects might vary due to personal characteristics of the voters who received the mailers.  For instance, if Democratic voters were more likely to be encouraged by the information provided by the mailers, while the Republican voters were less likely to be encouraged or even were discouraged by the mailers, the turnouts as well as the outcome of the election would not remain unchanged obviously.

### Question 3
This information will change my assessment to some degree, but not thoroughly. As the question reveals, the number of voters identified as likely liberal to centrist leaning in Democratic leaning precincts that the mailers were sent to exceed more than one third of the number of voters identified as conservative to centrist in Republican leaning precincts, which was done intentionally to make up for the anticipated turnout difference between the Republican voters and Democratic voters. It somehow reduces my first concern mentioned in the last answer that the outcome of the election would be changed by the experiment due to the ideology of the voters. However, as they did not show how they calculated the difference between the number of samples among Republican and Democratic voters, I am not fully convinced that such control could accurately avoid potential influence on the outcome. Other concerns of mine that the outcome might be altered by the experiment and that the research did not comply with the four principles remain the same. 

### Question 4
My assessment remains the same. Even though the judicial race had been closely contested as the researchers stated, I cannot be convinced that their intervention in the election was thus reasonable and legal. According to consequentialism, this experiment is not ethical because the potential consequence could be uncontrolled and harmful, even if their intention was not malicious. Furthermore, even though the researchers’ statement that the result of the elections were not changed was credible, we cannot thus determine that their primary study is safe and ethic. 

### Question 5 and 6
I still stand with my previous assessment of the research. Researchers should strike a balance between consequentialism and deontology. The study did not obey the four ethical principles in primary. Hence the study is originally not ethical regardless of the result of the consequence of the election.

### Question 7
The fact that the principal investigator is the co-founder of CrowdPAC deteriorates the ethics of the research even further. Firstly, since the research utilized the data provided by CrowPAC, Adam Bonica and his company might benefit from the study if the study goes on smoothly. Therefore, Bonica might be biased towards the study and had the motivation to help the study be investigated smoothly, which ruined the ethics of the study. Besides, as CrowdPAC provides tools to organize activist communities and fund political campaigns, the company probably has strong relationship with political groups. For example, if CrowdPAC has a close tie with the Democratic Party, Bonica could become less likely to deny the justice of the study if the mailers convey information in favor of the Democratic Party, or even worse, conveyed this kind of information intentionally. To make the study more objective and less bias-prone, the researchers should inform the public of this relationship in the paper.

### Question 8
If I were the principal investigators, I would redesign the study complying with the four principles of ethical research. 

First, we would show more respect to persons. I would first send emails to the potential participants for agreement on being involved in the experiment. In this email, they should be fully informed of the purpose and benefits of the research, the methods and tools going to be used, the possible risk, and compensation promise. Not to compromise the scientific value of the research, I would be very careful about revealing details of the study without influencing the observations’ behaviors. If some of them refused to being a part of the study, I would find a similar person and try to ask this person for agreement.

Second, we would keep the balance between benefits and risks. The study was involved more than 100,000 voters in Montana — nearly one third of the total number of voters in this election, which could have changed the outcomes of the election greatly. As research ethics suggests, we should make our studies as small as possible and generate a small yet effective sample. In addition to consulting experts, I would also ask non-researchers for advice and put myself in everyone else’s shoes.

Third, we would enhance the Justice by providing compensation to the participants and the Montanan state. 

As for the principle of Respect of Law and Public Interest, we should firstly investigate the laws of Montana State and remove any potential designs that might break laws. Then we should report our research to the Institutional Review Boards in both universities. After our study is allowed by the IRBs, we should ask Montana government for permission to conduct such a study. We should avoid using the Great Seal of Montana State in the study. In addition, we should reveal all conflicts of interest in the paper and to inform the public of the goals, methods, and results at all stages of our research process and to take responsibility for the actions.

Furthermore, we could change the way we explore the answer to the question whether voters who are given more information are more likely to vote. Instead, we could design a survey to evaluate how much the potential voters were informed of the candidates and the election, and observe whether they voted. This study combines observation and survey，and avoids intervention in the election.
