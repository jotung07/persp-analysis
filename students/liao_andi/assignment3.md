## What Kind of Pictures are Popular for Different Bloggers on Instagram? A Computationally-Enhanced Experimental Research

### I. Research Background & Question

#### **Why Experimental Method?**

The research topic of this week will be similar to that of observational study and digitally-enhanced survey study. However, the research topic, i.e., finding out the most popular types of pictures for different bloggers on Instagram, will be slightly adjusted to better illustrate the essence of experimental studies.

As we have discussed before, Instagram users respond to Instagram posts differently based on their relationships to bloggers as well as photo content categories of posts. However, there are some potential **confounding factors** exist in the process of interactions between users and bloggers, which makes it hard to isolate the influence we interested in.

For example, users might give more comments to photos of delicious food posted by their friends because they are happier when they know the updated status of their friends. In contrast, if the same photo were posted by strangers, users wouldn't give any comment or like simply because users would not feel any positive emotion.

In other words, perhaps, it is not photo content categories or relationship between users and bloggers that leads to comments or likes. It might be the changing of mood that facilitate the interaction. If this competing theory is true, we will not be able to focus on the effect of photo content categories posted by different bloggers by using observational study or digitally-enhanced survey study. Both methods require no treatment on participants, which might fail to exclude confounding factors in the process of study.

Therefore, the current research will utilize the method of randomized controlled experiments.

#### **Research Question & Hypothesis**

This research concentrate on this interesting question: **given different relationships between users and bloggers, which categories of photo content on Instagram will receive the most comments or likes from users?**

Here we simplify the scope of independent and dependent variables for conducting experiments more easily and precisely.

* **Independent Variables**:

  There are two independent variables in this research, **the relationship between users and bloggers, and the categories of photo content**.

  As for the first independent variable, there are three various levels - **friends, strangers and celebrities**.

  Different from previous study, only top three popular photo categories from "friends, food, gadget, captioned photos, pet, activity, selfie and fashion" will be selected. Findings of observational study and digitally-enhanced survey study will be used here.

  The reduction of photo content levels is quite necessary, as it will dramatically lessen the pressure of giving treatment and analyzing data. For now, we suppose that **"food, pet and activity"** are the most popular photo content categories on Instagram based on previous research.

* **Dependent Variables**:

  Furthermore, there are two dependent variables in this research, **the number of comments and the number of likes**, which both serve as the indicator of popularity.

Given the discussion above, our hypothesis is this: **Users tend to give more comments and likes to photos belong to categories of "food", and this tendency is more obvious when users are friends with bloggers.**


### II. Research Design

#### **Research Method**

The research method will be randomize controlled and computationally-enhanced experiments.

To better control irrelevant variables and confounding factors, a sub-platform of Instagram will be established to carry the experiment. The platform will be maximally identical to Instagram platform, expect two aspects:

* The sub-platform is built and maintained by the researcher;
* Only selected contents will appear on the sub-platform.

For the sake of efficiency, the research design will be a mixed **3(between-group variable: relationship between users and bloggers, friends/strangers/celebrities) * 3(within-group: photo content categories, food/pet/ activity)** one.

#### **Project Framework**

The research project will be executed in four steps:

* **Recruiting Participants**:

  This step is majorly digitalized.

  Participants will be recruited via online recruiting platforms. Those who are interested in the study will be asked to provide their Instagram accounts for pre-selecting process.

  Our target is to filter users who barely use Instagram or remain inactive for a long period of time. Therefore, only those experienced and active Instagram users will enter our sample pool. An estimate of 180 qualified participants will be chosen.

* **Randomizing**:

  This step is fully digitalized.

  Participants will be assigned randomly to one of three experimental groups, i.e., "friends" group, "strangers" group or "celebrities" group. Each participant will go through all three categories of photo contents within his subgroup assigned.

* **Delivering Treatments**:

  This step is fully digitalized.

  The experiment will be divided into two parts.

  In the first part, participants are required to go through 15 photos posted by strangers without extra instructions. These photos contain three categories: food, pet and activity, and they will be exactly the same as what we read on the real Instagram platform, even with some fake likes and comments. Participants can give comments, click "likes" button, or do nothing to whatever post they see.

  In the second half of the experiment, participants will read an detailed introduction page about Rebecca and Jack.

  * For the "friends" group, the description they are going to read is about their **friends** Rebecca and Jack.

  * For the "strangers" group, the introduction will be the same material, except the detail that Rebecca and Jack are **strangers**.

  * For the "celebrities" group, Rebecca and Jack will be **well-known people**, with blue verified accounts. Other information will remain the same.

  However, Rebecca and Jack are non-real Instagram accounts created by researchers.

  After reading the introduction, participants will go through another 30 photos posted by Rebecca and Jack. Same as before, these photos contain categories of food, pet and activity, and participants can either comment, like or ignore as response to each post.

* **Measuring Outcomes**:

  This step is fully digitalized.

  Dependent variables, namely, number of likes and comments, will be automatically collected by the sub-platform we build.

  We expect to see that:
  * at the between-group level, users in the "friend" group give the most comments and likes, followed by users in the "celebrity" group;
  * at the within-group level, users give the most comments and likes to photos about "food".

### III. Discussion

* **Validity**

  In this research, I choose to **sacrifice external validity for internal validity**.

  Compared to previous observational study and digitally-enhanced survey study, this experiment is far from nature. It is not in the real Instagram platform, and neither bloggers nor posts are real. Furthermore, posts in the experiment are limited to three specific categories. Given these unrealistic controls, it might be hard to generalize the outcome of this experiment directly to the real world.

  However, **the cost of external validity is worthwhile**. By designing experiments in a strictly controlled way, we are able to observe how users change their behavior, when they see different photo contents posted by same bloggers under different identities. Irrelevant variables and confounding factors are excluded, therefore, we can concentrate on the simple causal relationship between independent variables and dependent variables. In other words, the internal validity is guaranteed to a maximum extent.

* **Heterogeneity of Treatment Effects**

  **The average of treatment effects** is utilized in the current research.

  Users have various habits of response to posts on Instagram - some users prefer to "like" every post, and other users tend to do nothing most of the time. Moreover, they might also respond to the treatment of Rebecca and Jack in various ways. To overcome this problem, we calculate the average treatment effect, rather than dividing users into subgroups according to their behavior patterns.

  The reason for focusing on the average difference before treatment and after treatment is that **certain extreme behavior patterns can be cancelled out**.

  If someone comments under nearly every post in first-half and second-half of the experiment, it will not greatly affect the conclusion, as we are interested in the average treatment effect.

  However, if we try to cluster users into subgroups and observe treatment effect within each subgroup, it will be extremely hard to realize and generalize. There are a variety number of behavior patterns of users, so it will take extra time and energy for researchers to classify different subgroups at the beginning. Furthermore, the clustering method itself might bring in unexpected errors as well.

  After considering the pros and cons of using average treatment effect and clustering method, we select the average treatment effect as its advantages overweigh its disadvantages.

* **Causal Mechanisms**

  **The baseline before different treatment** is used to explore casual mechanisms.

  For every participant, a baseline of responding to "completely strangers" is measured, and the relative treatment effect is obtained by comparing the difference between the first half and the second half of the experiment. The conditions are as follows:

  * **Before treatment**: first-half = baseline
    * **"Friends" group**: second-half = baseline + "friend" food, pet and activity
    * **"Strangers" group**: second-half = baseline + "strangers" food, pet and activity
    * **"Celebrities" group**: second-half = baseline + "celebrities" food, pet and activity
  * **Treatment effect**: second half - first-half

  The main effect of relationship between users and bloggers can be obtained by comparing the results of "friends", "strangers" and "celebrities" group. And the main effect of categories of photo contents is calculated by comparing the responses to "food", "pet" and "activity" across groups. **The interaction between relationship between users and bloggers and categories of photo contents will answer the core research question**.

  As discussed above, the causal mechanism between different treatment and user behaviors can be inferred by the mixed research design. However, we are unable to dig out the deeper motivation of this causal mechanism in this study. Therefore, further studies are essential for fully understand why users prefer certain kind of pictures posted by certain type of bloggers.
