## The ethics of the Montana election experiment

### I. Four principles of ethical research

#### 1.  Respect for persons
Unfortunately, this study didn't show much respect for participants.

**Researchers failed to provide informed consent with relevant information about Montana election experiment for voters in the chosen sample.** Instead, they began the experiment by sending mailers directly to participants, without even telling them that there was an election experiment going on.

**Obviously, voters weren't treated as autonomous individuals in this case.** They didn't give consent to researchers to conduct the election experiment on themselves; neither did they have the choice to opt out the election experiment. Researchers simply assumed that everybody was willing to take part in the experiment.

**Given the reason above, I think that this election experiment violated the principle of respect for persons.**

#### 2. Beneficence

Considering the principle of beneficence, researchers did quite well in the election experiment.

The principle of beneficence includes two parts: first, a benefit/risk analysis; second, a decision whether the combination of benefit/risk is balanced ethically.

**On the one hand, the benefit of this election experiment is clear** - to validate the hypothesis that voters with more information will be more likely to vote.

**On the other hand, the potential risk of the election experiment is really complex.** If the hypothesis were true, the outcome of 2014 Montana General Election would be intervened by stimulating more voters to participate in the vote. Researchers couldn't guarantee that the influence of having more voters would certainly lead to more positive outcomes. For instance, if the candidate elected by this intervened process turned out to be unqualified, it would be shameful as well as harmful to the election and legal system.

**Taking the benefit and risk into account, it is extremely difficult to decide which side is more dominating.** However, the benefit of the experiment is meaningful and stable, and the risk of generating negative outcome is uncertain with a relatively low probability. Therefore, it can be concluded that the benefit outweighed the risk in this election experiment.

**As discussed above, I believe that researchers have carefully evaluated the principle of beneficence for this election experiment**, and they observed the principle to maximize the benefit and minimize the risk for participants and the society.

#### 3. Justice

It's hard to tell whether or not researchers successfully followed the principle of justice in this election experiment.

Without extra information about sampling process, it is almost impossible to infer the sample distribution of voters in this research. The selection of 102,780 voters can be random or non-random. For example, it is likely that voters who could be easily mobilized to vote had higher chances of being chosen into the sample pool.

**Thus, we are unable to conclude that the benefit and risk of the election experiment were fairly distributed across the whole registered voters population in Montana.**

However, there is one thing for sure - voters receiving the mailers didn't receive compensation financially. What's worse, the result of the election experiment seems to  benefit potential candidates more than voters themselves. So voters had to bear the risk of choosing unqualified candidates without enjoying the benefit of the election experiment.

**Overall, my opinion is that the election experiment is somewhat unfair to voters, who risk more and benefit less.**

#### 4. Respect for law and public interest

**Without doubt, the election experiment did damage to the law and public interest.**

As described in the material, there is debate whether or not researchers violated the law. However, **I believe that the action of mailing should be considered as an attempt to intervene the voting process and influence the voting outcome without permission**.

If everybody could send information to voters as he will without breaking the law, then the election system would lose all its meaning as its outcome could be manipulated by anyone at random. Therefore, the election experiment violated the law, as the Commissioner of Political Practices of the State of Montana mentioned in the passage.

If we have a closer look at the content of mailers, the so-called "2014 Montana General Election Information Guide" with the Great Seal of the State of Montana is quite confusing and misleading. Voters might take mailers as a real and objective official information guide, and adjust their voting behaviors accordingly.

**Is this alteration good for the public interest? Perhaps yes, perhaps not.** The answer heavily depends on the information researchers provided and the action voters took. Stanford and Dartmouth stated that the mailing "didn't contain any advocacy supporting or opposing any candidate", but it is hard to be absolutely objective when putting candidates on the scale of liberalism and conservatism. If any subconscious preferences of researchers were mixed in the process of generating the scale, the public interest would suffer from personal preferences via changing voting behaviors. **The election experiment could harm the public interest, but we are unsure about that.**

Although I am not a student majoring in laws or public policy, **I do believe that the election experiment actually violated the law, and might harmed the public interest under some conditions.**

### II. Different scenarios

#### Q2: random sample
If voters in the chosen sample changed voting behaviors, the outcome of the Supreme Justice election would be altered.

For example, some voters might switch from "not going to vote" to "going to vote", at the same time, others might change from "voting candidate A" to "voting candidate B".

**As long as voters responded to contents of mailers by changing voting behaviors, the election would be affected.** The only way to avoid the alteration is that all voters in the sample pool decided to ignore mailers completely.

#### Q3: biased sample
The non-random sampling method will not change my assessment of the research design.

Indeed, the principle of justice might be influenced by recruiting more voters in the Democratic precincts. However, the influence is not qualitative; it is quantitative. Still, the benefit and risk is distributed unfairly across the population of voters. **The only difference is that, this time, it is the voters in the Democratic precincts who are more likely to be chosen, and have a higher chance of bearing the risk.**

**The principle of justice is violated despite the justification of sampling process.**

#### Q4: pre-analysis
This pre-analysis of the election before conducting the experiment will not change my assessment.

As we have discussed in the principle of beneficence, researchers tried really hard to minimize the risk of this election experiment. The analysis based on previous judicial elections about Montana further supported the argument that researchers made efforts to reduce the risk as much as possible. In other words, researchers carried out the experiment after carefully evaluating the potential election consequences of the manipulation of sending mailers.

**The principle of beneficence is validated by the additional piece of information about pre-analysis.** As we have affirmed the effort of minimizing the risk in the original version of assessment, the pre-analysis will not influence the result of our assessment.

#### Q5: post-data proof
The outcome data of the election will not change my assessment.

The outcome of the election proves that the pre-analysis is correct. Similar to Q4, researchers managed to control the risk of the election experiment within their abilities. As it is highly unlikely to totally reverse the situation with mailers only, we should believe that the risk is actually reduced rather than magnified.

Identical to Q4, **the principle of beneficence is validated by the outcome of the election**, and the assessment is unchanged for the same reason.

#### Q6: for-profit company
This piece of information about the for-profit company will not alter my assessment.

Although the score in the election experiment is calculated by using the algorithm of a for-profit company run by one of the principal investigators, it doesn't really influence the assessment.

As we have mentioned in the principle of law and public interests, public interests is threatened only if researchers generate the scale with personal preferences. Given that scores of CrowdPAC are claimed to be "objective" and CrowdPAC doesn't participate in the experiment directly, we can conclude that public interests are safe in this case.

**The principle of public interest is respected in this scenario**, and the assessment will not change as it is in accordance with our first version of assessment.

#### Q7: possible improvements
If I were the investigator, I would:
* Design the content of mailers carefully;
* Revise the title "Information Guide" and remove the seal from mailers;
* Send the debrief information to all the voters in the sample pool to ask for consents;
* Apply for IRB review before starting the experiment;
* Communicate with local judicial system to discuss the potential outcome of the election experiment;
* Consult with lawyers to avoid breaking the law.

**If permitted, I prefer to conduct the election experiment in a lab setting instead of in the real world.** Using the lab experiment will inevitably sacrifice the external validity to some extent, but it can largely reduce the ethical issue caused by real-world experiments.

Participants will be invited into the election lab for the election experiment. Consent forms and instructions will be provided before starting the session. Randomly, they will be divided into the "more information" group and the "control" group. Those in the "more information" group will have access to more information about candidates in the campaign. Then both groups of voters will vote, and the conclusion will be drawn using the data collected.

In the lab experiment, the intervention of voting process will not influence judicial system in the real-world, so the risk is minimized to the lowest level. Researchers also obey the law and protect public interests. Therefore, I think doing the experiment in the lab is a good solution to avoid the ethical issue of the original election experiment.
