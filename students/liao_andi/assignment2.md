## What Kind of Pictures are Popular on Instagram? A digitally-Enhanced Survey Research

### I. Research Background & Question

#### **Public Interactions on Instagram**

Similar to the observational study proposal last week, this research will based on Instagram pictures analysis as well. Some slight modifications, especially those on the research question, are quite necessary for meeting the demands of the current research design.

Typically, users follow **three various kinds of bloggers** on Instagram: **family members and friends, celebrities and strangers** (usually out of curiosity or admiration). As we have discussed in the previous proposal of observational study, **photos on Instagram** can be divided into eight categories, according to their contents: **friends, food, gadget, captioned photos, pet, activity, selfie and fashion**. It's self-evident that users will have different responses according to their personal relationships to bloggers as well as their individual interests in different photo contents.

To interact with bloggers, there are **three modes of interactions** users can choose from: **comments, likes and nothing**. Actually, there are several options for interactions besides comments and likes, including "adding to my favorites", but the data is private to the user himself. Although there might be some methods to acquire these private data inside Instagram platform, concerns will definitely arise when we publicize the hidden personal favorites data. Therefore, these other options will be viewed as "nothing" in the aspect of digital data.

#### **Research Question**

Based on the discussion above, we believe that **users choose the most appropriate interaction modes according to different kinds of users they are following and various types of photo contents**. For instance, users are more likely to give comments if their friends post photos of delicious food , as they know their friends will usually reply comments. But when it comes to celebrities, users might click the "likes" button instead of giving comments, probably because "likes" itself is enough to express their feelings towards stunning selfies of celebrity bloggers.

Therefore, the research question is: **for different types of Instagram users, which content categories of photos is the most popular?** In this research proposal, the method of digitally-enhanced survey study will be utilized to answer this research question.


### II. Research Design

#### **Research Method**

This research will be based on **digitally-enhanced survey study**, which means that both digital data and survey data will be collected and analyzed. The survey data will be served as the major source of data, while the digital data can be powerful supplements to the survey data. The variables of interest are as follows:

* **Digital data**:
  * User account name
  * Whether the account is blue verified (if so, this account will be categorized as celebrities)
  * List of following and followers
  * Total number of posts
  * Posts on Instagram from 2016.01.01 to 2016.12.31: photos, lists of comments and likes
<br>
* **Survey data**:
  * Demographic information: gender, age, region, job and education  
  * Blogger classification: classify Instagram accounts that they are following into three categories - family members and friends, celebrities and strangera
  * Questionnaire: This questionnaire will focus on attitudes and behavior towards various posts of different users referring to previous well-established questionnaires. Several sample questions are as follows:

    * **Attitude questions**:
      * On a scale of 1 to 5, how much joy do you feel when you see your favorite actress post her selfie on Instagram?

    * **Behavior questions**:
      * What kind of users will you follow on Instagram?
      * What will you do if you friend post a photo with his dog, comments, likes or simply adding to your favorites?

#### **Project Framework**

The research project will be executed in three steps:

* **Data Collection and Pre-processing**:
<br>
  * **Choosing sample**:
    To be honest, it's hard to select an ideal sample for this study. If we choose to use probability sampling, it might be extremely hard to select an example whose distribution is identical to that of the whole population. Instead, we will utilize non-probability sampling, and make necessary adjustments in the process of data analysis. Generally speaking, participants will be recruited based on the principle of volunteering.
<br>
  * **Collecting data**:
    Participants will be required to finish questionnaires and their personal Instagram accounts. Researchers will only extract relevant Instagram data according to accounts provided by participants.
<br>
  * **Pre-processing**:
    To ensure the quality of collected data, standards of complete questionnaires as well as active Instagram accounts will be established and used to filter unqualified data.
<br>
* **Analyzing Data**:

    The self-report attitudes and behaviors towards various types of users and contents will be generated from the survey data. Digital trace will be clustered and accumulated using the method similar to the observational study proposed last week. Then the corresponding data of attitudes, behaviors and digital trace will be accumulated by blogger types and photo contents.
<br>
* **Drawing Conclusion**:

    By comparing data of attitudes, behaviors and digital trace on the level of blogger types and photo contents, we can figure out that how users interact with different kinds of bloggers along with various types of photo contents. Hopefully, what users report can be in accordance with what they behave.
</br>
    **Interaction effect between blogger types and photo contents** is expected. For instance, users might prefer to give comments to the pet photo of their friends, but simply click "likes" for activity photos of their idols. Therefore, both blogger types and photo contents might influence the result of the most popular photos on Instagram.


### III. Discussion

#### **What Makes it a Digitally-Enhanced Survey Study?**

Digitally-enhanced survey study is the most suitable research method for this research, as both survey data and digital data are equally  essential.

Honestly, survey data alone can finish the fundamental research task as well, but the research will become a traditional psychology behavior study, which merely utilize questionnaires to measure self-report attitudes and behaviors of Instagram users.

However, with the help of digital data, researchers can **build a reference system for self-reported attitudes and behaviors**. In other words, digital trace provides a way to validate what participants claim on the questionnaires.

Moreover, **digital data offers additional accurate data that couldn't be obtained from survey data**, such as how many friends and family members are users following on Instagram, and how many comments or likes are under a certain Instagram photo. Therefore, digital data enhances the reliability of survey data dramatically.

Given the discussion above, both survey data and digital data contribute to the success of this study. As the survey data lies in the core of this research, the research method should be addressed as "digitally-enhanced survey study".

#### **Why is a Survey Study Better Than an Observational Study?**

An observational study focus only on the digital data, as a result, some important parts of data will be ignored.

For instance, it will be difficult to figure out whether bloggers are friends or strangers to users, because Instagram doesn't demonstrate the relationship between bloggers and users. Another example is the option to "adding to my favorite", which is private to the user himself. The only way to obtain such data is by self-report.

If digital data is combined with survey data, those disadvantages mentioned above can be overcame. Not only do we know how people behave; we also know how they think. The survey study allows researchers to access data that doesn't show on the Instagram interface by directly asking questions.

Therefore, we can obtain two aspects of data in a survey study - self-report attitudes and behaviors, and digital trace - to explore, and a more accurate conclusion can be made from the survey study by combining and comparing survey data and digital data together.

#### **Potential Errors and Solutions**

* **Representation Errors**:
  The biggest potential problem of this research is that participants we recruited might be a biased sample of the whole population. Usually, users who have more free time are more likely to participate in the survey, and this subgroup will be overrepresented in the sample. The representation error cannot be underestimated in this research.
</br>  
  Fortunately, the representation error can be corrected by adjusting weights of different subgroups in the sample. If older users are overrepresented in the sample we draw, the weight of older users should be decreased to match their proportion in the population of Instagram users.
<br>
* **Measurement Errors**:
  Another source of error comes from questionnaires. In some occasion, the wording or the choice of survey questions makes it hard for participants to convey their true ideas, although questionnaires are inherited from previous successful questionnaires. If the survey fails to measure exactly variables we are interested in, the research conclusion will be unconvincing as a consequence.
</br>
  The measurement error can be modified by two approached. The first way is to conduct a pilot study, and invite experts to review. The second way is to add some open-ended questions at the end of the survey and allow participants to express themselves without restrictions.
