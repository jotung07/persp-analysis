# Kaggle Open Call projects. Q 2

### Laurence Warner

The ['Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster'](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) competition is of interest to me.

##### Goal
Use training data to build a model which predicts the probability of survival of individuals based upon some predictive variables. Use this to predict which passengers in the testing set of data survived.

##### Submission
In the test.csv file, for Passenger IDs 892-1309, assign either a 0 if you predict death or 1 if you predict survival.

##### Q3

I submit a Jupyter notebook which contains code for a plot about the age variable.
