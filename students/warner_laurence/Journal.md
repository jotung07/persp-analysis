# Improving a Journal Article

### Laurence Warner

My article is ["Gender bias in open source: Pull request acceptance of women versus men"](https://peerj.com/preprints/1733v1/)

This is an observational study analyzing data from GitHub on probability of pull request acceptance based on gender.

### Human computation version
Ask MTurk workers who understand code to decide whether to accept a pull request. Control group: can't see gender. Treatment group: can see gender.

### Improvement
The observational study may be picking up unobservable traits. For example, perhaps gender correlates with the unobservable variable of reputation in the social network of GitHub. A human computation study with strangers abstracts away from this to focus purely on gender.
