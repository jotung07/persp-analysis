# Ethics Assignment - The ethics of the Montana election experiment

1. Assess this study using Salganik's four principles of ethical research.

# 1. Respect for Persons
There was no effort to obtain consent to take part in this experiment. However, I would argue that the mere act of receiving a mailer doesn't even constitute an intervention that requires consent. If the researchers forced the recipients to actually *read* the document that would require consent. However, the recipient consents to the intervention when they choose to read the literature.
If you don't buy that argument, perhaps citing the implied pressure to read the literature from the presence of the seal, I would still argue that this does not contravene Salganik's principle "some form of consent for most research". I argue that delivering harmless material once is such a minor intervention, lack of consent can be justified if other benefits are present (discussed later).

# 2. Beneficence
Certainly, this intervention does no *harm* to subjects.
I would argue that it actually benefits society in a very minor way by raising awareness, which will lead to better informed voting decisions. This is based on a belief that the pretense of judges being non-partisan is unhelpful, and efforts to better inform voters of judges positions based upon factual detail like donations (campaign finance being an especially under-recognised factor in US politics by voters) is beneficial.

# 3. Justice
The nature of the benefits is that they are enjoyed collectively, through slightly more informed voting behavior. There aren't really any individual benefits (and as argued harms), so we need not worry about distributive issues particularly - as long as randomization is used in choosing the sample (discussed later).

# 4. Respect for law and public interest
Fine on this front. It is legal to send mailers and as argued in the public interest.

Overall I would argue that there are no major ethical concerns with this study.

1. Assume that the mailers were sent to a random sample of voters: under what conditions might this mailing have altered the outcome of the Supreme Court Justice election?

Large sample (100k+) so law of large numbers suggests that no bias in characteristics of recipients - leaving aside slight bias in homeownership.

1. In fact, the mailers were not sent to a random sample of voters. According to a report by Jeremy Johnson (a political scientists who assisted in the investigation), mailers "were sent to 64,265 voters identified as likely liberal to centrist leaning in Democratic leaning precincts and 39,515 voters identified as conservative to centrist in Republican leaning precincts. The researchers justified the disparity between Democratic and Republican numbers on grounds that they anticipated turnout to be significantly lower among Democratic voters." Does this change your assessment of the research design? If so, how?

Let's assume that the leaflets assertions of political partisanship of judges is accurate. Let's assume that receiving leaflet raises probability of voting for judge with same partisanship.

A consequence of this sampling bias is to raise the vote for Democratic leaning judges.

However, magnitude will probably be very small.

And from a deontological viewpoint, you can argue that it is an ethical service to inform any voter that they were mistakenly voting out of their interest previously. Consequences are not ethically relevant in this framework.

For a mixture of those reasons, it is not a huge concern.

1. In response to the investigation, the researchers said that they picked this election in part because "neither judicial race had been closely contested in the primary. Based on an analysis of the 2014 primary election results in the context of previous Montana judicial elections, the researchers determined that the research study as designed would not change the outcome of either contest." Does this change your assessment of the research? If so, how?

No, because I didn't buy the consequentialist argument. But it reduces the impact of the consequentialist argument nonetheless.

1. In fact, the election turned out to be not particularly close.

    | Candidates               | Votes received | Percentage |
    |--------------------------|----------------|------------|
    | Supreme Court Justice #1 |                |            |
    | W. David Herbert         | 65,404         | 21.59%     |
    | Jim Rice                 | 236,963        | 78.22%     |
    | Supreme Court Justice #2 |                |            |
    | Lawrence VanDyke         | 134,904        | 40.80%     |
    | Mike Wheat               | 195,303        | 59.06%     |

    Does this change your assessment of the research? If so, how?

Consequentialist argument is looking pretty weak.

1. One of the principal investigators for the Montana election study ([Adam Bonica](http://web.stanford.edu/~bonica/)) is also the co-founder of [CrowdPAC](https://www.crowdpac.com/), a for-profit company which "calculates objective scores for political candidates showing their overall political position" using, in part, the same data used to score the judicial candidates in Montana. While a source of objective information for voters to make decisions about candidates, CrowdPAC also provides tools to organize activist communities and fund political campaigns (all for a fee). Does this change your assessment of the research? If so, how?

It does make me slightly more skeptical about the deontological argument of helping citizens - it seems that he might have been using them to further his PR ambitions.

However, on a meta level, as long as that conflict of interest is declared so people like me can alter opinions slightly as above, I have no objection in principle to this guy making some dollar on the side.

1. What, if anything, would you have done differently if you were the principal investigators? How would you have designed the study if you were interested in exploring whether additional information increases voter turnout in nonpartisan races?
Use smaller sample but look for higher magnitude results. Follow small group of consenting individuals and vary information from low to very high information overload.
