# InfluenzaNet

### Laurence Warner

1.
##### Design
Google Flu Trends uses search keywords to try to predict Influenza Like Illnesses (ILI).
Traditional tracking systems consist of primary care physicians reporting frequency of patients exhibiting ILI to them.
InfluenzaNet is a middle ground, where the data is gathered directly from citizens on the internet, but it is targeted to people who actively choose to report ILI.

##### Costs
Google Flu Trends is practically costless. It tracks already gathered data. InfluenzaNet costs a little to run and advertise website. Traditional systems are costly as physicians are effectively paid for this service.

##### Errors
Google Flu Trends has been shown to overestimate flu. It picks up false signals.
InfluenzaNet may be confounded by the varying popularity of using the website.
Traditional systems are slow to respond, but not very error prone.

2.
Traditional systems don't respond quickly so may miss the outbreak. Google Flu Trends may overestimate if non-ILI people are anxiously searching. InfluenzaNet is probably the most robust as people only use if they present symptoms.
