### The Four Principles of Ethical Research

#### Respect for Persons

The idea that individuals should be autonomous and that those with diminished autonomy should receive additional protections underpins the concept of respecting persons that Salganik describes. The researchers at Stanford and Dartmouth were interested in answering the question - will voters who receive more information be more likely to vote? 

The ethical firestorm surrounding this experiment hinges over whether or not the mailers sent to voters impacted their autonomy to make their own decision at the ballot box. Additionally, informed consent was not obtained from participants prior to the experiment; and while the researchers seemingly attempted to counterbalance this with their inclusion of a disclaimer (meant to inform voters of the sponsorship and origin of the mailer) in the mailer, this was provided after the "treatment" was already applied. Indeed, once a voter consumes the information on the mailer, there is no undoing that process, unseeing that information, or reversing the treatment. Herein lies a major ethical concern of swaying voters opinions and potential voting behavior without their prior consent to being exposed to such information, regardless of its' partisanship. Moreover, the purposeful inclusion of the Montana State Seal strongly misrepresents government-sponsorship of the mailer. Voters possess varying degrees of access to information, levels of education, and time that would allow them to effectively form meaningful judgment of such a mailer. 

However, strong arguments against an ethical breach exist. One might assert that most voters are informed members of the public who are freely able to discern misinformation or partisan attempts to sway their opinion. In fact, voters already actively do this in consuming information on news outlets (print, internet, and television), social media, political campaign advertisements, or through direct interactions with campaigns. While a singular mailer certainly adds to the "noise" that inundates voters in election cycles, its singular quantity arguably is minimal in impacting voters' relative decision-making. Moreover, the mailers clearly and explicitly stated both universities involved in this research study, identified this as a research study, and provided a relevant link for further information. There is validity to the argument that the deluge of information, as well as its full spectrum of partisanship or accuracy, is an inherent part of how the democratic process operates. To expose voters to this full spectrum is to respect them as participants in a democracy.

From a broad perspective, the researchers of this study did not severely undercut their respect for persons in this experiment. Their singular mailer is a grain of sand on the beach of election cycle content; and those familiar with the American political cycles can attest to prevalence of self-inflated, inaccurate, or purposefully false content released by campaigns and Political Action Committees or covered in the 24-hour news cycle.

#### Beneficence

To assess the risk/benefit profile of the Montana election experiment, we examine the objectives of the experiment and steps taken to answer the research questions. To start, we should question the researchers decision not to obtain Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for the experiment. This is a key step in ensuring that potential adverse events are minimized. 

The first major objective was to determine whether more information was necessarily improved voter turnout. While solidifying the meaning of "better" is inherently a subjective process, in an era defined by an excess, rather than a shortage, of information, this becomes a question of information quality. With Montana State Supreme Court elections nonpartisan in nature, injecting in this mailer that explicitly classifies candidates on a political spectrum morphs the race into something partisan in nature. While injecting partisanship into an election may not be directly detrimental to voters, aside from potentially causing additional stress, exposure to negative campaign practices, etc., this practice arguably compromises the spirit of a pre-defined democratic structure and process. This dovetails with the assumption that greater voter engagement benefits a democracy.

This assumption is not one we should automatically accept. Typical proponents of democracy assert that quantity of democratic participation has a positive relation to quality of democracy. This judgment should be reserved until the actions of elected officials can be assessed against their ability to protect, defend, and advocate for all people in a democracy. To blindly consider the pure expansion of the democratic process as beneficial is naive. The "democratic" process has historically resulted in the preservation and government sponsorship of slavery, nativist laws, genocide of indigenous populations, and inequitable treatment of virtually all groups aside from heterosexual white men, to name just a few. 

Therefore, it is difficult to assess the extent to which researchers truly balanced the potential costs with benefits until the elected Justices records can be assessed in tandem. Short-term risk may be minimal for voters involved - perhaps the simple inconvenience of receiving the mailer; yet, in the longer-term Justices can institute decisions that have broad consequences for already marginalized groups of people. 

#### Justice

The concept of justice, as argued in the Belmont Report, centers around the distribution of the burdens and benefits of research. While initially designed to prevent researchers from preying upon the vulnerable, disenfranchised, or less-educated, the definition has shifted to increasing inclusion from historically underrepresented populations. 

The 100,000 voters who received the mailers in Montana were clearly the group who bore the "burden" for this experiment. We also know that the burden was not spread evenly throughout the broader voting population of Montana. In particular, liberal-leaning and conservative-leaning voters were chosen are recipients for the mailers. Moreover, of those chosen, some 60,000 were identified liberal-leaning voters. 

While there was no compensation for participation in this study, an argument could be made that potential benefits of the experiment would be distributed across society. These benefits may include an improved understanding of how information shapes voter turnout or how distribution of information impacts democratic participation by ideology. Had the researchers aimed to more broadly spread the benefits of research, perhaps they should have considered targeting minority groups and groups historically underrepresented at the ballot box to ensure their democratic voice would be heard. 

#### Respect for Law & Public Interest

Striking the balance between adhering to the law and pursuit of knowledge can be challenging and the Stanford and Dartmouth researchers' use of the state seal of Montana highlights this difficulty. One must also consider the potential insights the public could gain from findings of such research. 

The researcher's use of the state seal on Montana crosses a line (and potentially the law) unnecessarily. Voters would have likely still read and digested the information on the mailer had the state seal not been present - including the seal gives the impression of government-sponsorship. If the primary purpose was to convey what was supposedly, non-partisan information, then inclusion of a state seal is irrelevant and certainly brings into question the researchers' ethical considerations. 

That being said, a strong argument can still be made in defense of this research experiment from the lens of public interest. Researchers, as well as public officials, in this era should take a wider view of the law. As the United States seeks to protect and defend its democratic institutions in the aftermath of the 2016 election cycle, understanding the methods, strategies, and avenues through which voter behavior can be manipulated is key. Election interference in 2016 was considerably more elaborate and sophisticated than sending out a hundred thousand mailers - we know this from FaceBook officials' recent congressional testimony to the over-hundred million users reached by foreign-based instigators. Thus, in some instances, to respect the law is to come to an understanding of how to defend the law. In other words, short-term transgressions of law that yield long-term outcomes that allow us to better defend fair and equitable laws are justified. 

### The Sampling of Voters (Q's 2, 3, and 7)

The researchers at Stanford and Dartmouth chose not to send the mailers to a random sample of voters. In fact, likely liberal or center-left voters were targeted at a rate of 2-to-1 over center-right/conservative voters. One might imagine a circumstance in which the Supreme Court candidate races were quite close - sending the mailers may potentially alter the result of the election. However, one should be reluctant to readily accept as fact that a singular mailer piece, containing relatively shallow and benign information placing candidates on a political spectrum, will sway a voter. As previously highlighted, the broader perspective one should keep in mind is that of the following - beyond that single piece of mail were countless television commercials, advertisements on the internet, phone banking efforts, visits from canvassers. Furthermore, the sheer number of complaints from voters signals that many individuals would not be swayed so easily in their behavior. Finally, it is difficult to conceive that single piece of mail would convince thousands of voters to flock to the polls as even the most experienced get-out-the-vote coordinators can attest to the difficulty of mobilizing supporters. Therefore, the researchers' targeting of left vs. right leaning voters should not significantly affect any assessment of ethics in this instance.  

In the spirit of the principle of Justice, we can hypothesize how voter sampling could have been different if we were principal investigators. We should extend our discussion towards whether one should actively oversampled groups who's political voice has historically been suppressed. This would include voters of color, lower-income voters, etc. To extend the benefits of research, it would make sense to engage those particular citizens to study methods to better increase their participation in the democratic process. Moreover, the information provided to voters should focus on providing methods for getting them to the polls. Broad information about candidates does less to impact turnout versus targeted information about polling locations, voting options (in-person vs. absentee), voting hours, or potential transportation. 

### Contested Races (Q's 4, 5, and 7)

Without knowing incumbent-status, fundraising data, or previous involvement in politics, one can observe a major difference in ideology between the winners of both elections with Justice Rice being much farther left than Justice Wheat. In considering the apparent non-competitiveness in these judicial contests, the researchers' justification to experiment on these particular elections is sound. Decisions to intervene in the democratic process should be made with careful consideration so as not to alter what would have been the "true" choice of the voters. On the potential spectrum of partisanship political "information" can take on, the particular mailer used skews towards being less overtly partisan. This preserves, to some extent, the ethical standing of the study and does not alter my assessment of the research. 

Had I been a principal investigator in a such a study, I would have similarly chosen an election to minimize the probability of the experiment changing the final result. 

### Researcher's Involvement in CrowdPAC (Q's 6 & 7)

Adam Bonica's involvement with CrowdPAC raises concerns around conflict of interest and should flag additional ethical concerns. As a researcher and academic, the study should purely be an exercise in obtaining deeper insight and knowledge towards the democratic process. This interest as a researcher becomes inexplicably tied with his interests as a co-Founder of a for-profit organization who's mission is to increase political participation. While it appears from a brief browsing of the CrowdPAC website that the intent of the organization is to hand political power back towards the people, anytime for-profit interests are intertwined with supposedly "non-partisan" research, there should be concern. 

The insight Bonica gains from such an experiment will no doubt be carried over to into the academic realm for many to benefit from. Yet, what goes hand-in-hand is that that knowledge will invariably also carry over to a for-profit organization like CrowdPAC and inform how they will operate moving forward. While such an organization can espouse objectivity and non-partisanship, practicing such is far from guaranteed. Will this knowledge gained allow CrowdPAC to secretively support left or right leaning candidates in more effective manners? Will this knowledge gained allow CrowdPAC to provide key information only to campaigns that afford them? These are, of course, questions without answers at this time, but certainly shift the motivations behind such a study into murkier ethical territory. 

As such, I would argue this potential for-profit motive associated with Bonica presents the single largest ethical qualm in this study. By and large, I would argue the ethical shortcomings of the study, including the failure to properly consult with the IRBs of both Stanford and Dartmouth and the choice to utilize the official state seal of Montana are largely overcome with the potential knowledge to gained. Yet, given the unknown consequences with providing such significant knowledge to some for-profit entity, greater caution should be used going forward.
