Paper Title: Tifferet, S., & Vilnai-Yavetz, I. (2018). Self-presentation in LinkedIn portraits: Common features, gender, and occupational differences. Computers in Human Behavior, 80, 33-48.

The paper describes an analysis of 480 LinkedIn portraits which were analyzed for common features, gender and occupational differences. The goal of the study was to highlight variability in how men and women present themselves on their Linkedin portrait. A team of three coders analyzed nearly 500 LinkedIn portraits to extract similarities, based on a questionnaire 

**"How would you formulate the data collection as a human computation project"**

After portraits have been scraped from the appropriate LinkedIn profiles, I will use human computation to replace the three coders in the study. The researchers used only 480 portraits as they had three coders at their disposal, and were forced to optimize their resources under a constrained time frame. I will increase this number to 2000 portraits. Then, I will use human computation to collect data about the specific features of the portraits using the same questionnaire employed by the researchers. This project lends itself particuarly easily to human computation as coders do not need too much training to identify the overt physical features of LinkedIn portraits. For instance, the item that required the most training "face symmetry", in which participants had to determine if faces were skewed to the left or right direction in the photo. In this research, volunteers will first undergo a 19-photo training session in which they will learn to classify each of the 19-items used by the researchers. Then volunteers will complete a 20-item quiz in which they classify 20 portraits, each along the 19 portrait variables used by the researchers. A >90% accuracy performance on this quiz would transition volunteers into classifiers for the experiment. All coders will code all the 2000 portraits to maximize *redundancy*.

The collected data would first be filtered to remove responses from manipulating participants. Then a series of bias deduction studies will be implemented in which classifiers will code monochrome and physically altered versions of the LinkedIn portraits. The detected biases will be adjusted for. Finally, an iterative weighting procedure will be used to give greatest weighting to coding from best classifiers. 

**How might this improve the study?**

A human computation approach will allow the study to have a larger sample size. This will bolster the study as the present weakness of this research is its lack of cultural plurality. That is, the authors make it clear that their clustering of LinkedIn portraits is not applicable to non-Western cultures. Using the present human computation approach, we are able to sample a larger number of portraits that can be taken from LinkedIn profiles in India and Indonesia. Therefore, this approach will help generalize the authors' claims to other cultures. Second, this approach utilizes many more coders than those used by the authors. Hence, the resulting coding will reduce the likelihood of systematic biases possessed by the three specific coders in the initial study.Overall, if workers from cheap-labor markets are employed, this approach may save the costs assosciated with having full-time RAs to do the coding in the USA.
