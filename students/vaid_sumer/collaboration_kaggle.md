**Describe one dataset that is of interest to you:**
 
I am interested in Corporaci√≥n Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting Competition.
 

**What is the goal of the competition? **

Grocery forecasting is a precarious business as success is contigent on accurately forecasting purchases and sales so items do not sell out (creating a loss due to lost sales) or are left in overstock (creating a loss due to perishable goods). This problem is magnified when one has to deal with stocks across many supermarket branches.  The goal of the competition is to build a model that accurately predicts product sales. The grocery chain currently uses a subjective and data-sparse method of predicting future forecasting. The goal of the competition is to replace this existing system with a better predicting, data driven machine learning model that can make accurate grocery predictions across locations. 


**What would you have to do to make a submission?**

I will have to enter into the competition before January 2018.  I will have to use the training data and supplementary information files to develop a machine learning model that can accurately forecast grocery sales for multiple locations of the grocery store, and for some items that were not present in the training data. Then I will have to test my model on the test data, and submit this .csv file to Kaggle. This .csv file will contain predictions about inventory requirements for the future. My predictions will be evaluated against a metric developed by the grocery chains that especially rewards correct predictions for perishable items. Following months in which grocery store sales were projected, the project with the closest match in quantity forecasted will win the competition.
