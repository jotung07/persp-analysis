#Assess the ethics of the Montana election experiment assignment

###Author: Liqiang Yu
### 1. Assess this study using Salganik's four principles of ethical research.

####1. Respect for persons

The Montana election experiment did not exhibit respect for persons who were involved in this experiment. The Belmont Report defines the principle of Respect for Persons from two aspects: 1) individuals should be treated as autonomous and 2) individuals with diminished autonomy should be entitled to additional protections. In other words, if feasible, participants should be provided with detailed relevant information and then autonomously decide whether to take part in or not. Researchers who would like to apply this principle of Respect for Persons are supposed to receive this type of informed consent before proceeding. However, in the Montana election experiment, voters are 'forced' to participate in the research, i.e., the 102,780 subjects were not informed that they would be exposed to more information, which could influence their voting decision in the future. This is to say that they did not autonomously decide to join in or not. So, obviously, researchers should be blamed for their violation that they did not provide relevant information in a comprehensive format or acquire consent from any of the 102,780 voters. To be more technically, they did not follow the principle of Respect for Rersons.

####2. Beneficence

Researchers from Dartmouth and Stanford did not pay attention to beneficence in their study, which is all about improving the risk/benefit profile and striking a balance. There are mainly three things in risk/benefits analysis: understanding of the probability adverse events, analysis of severity of events and the impact on non-participant and social systems. First of all, although as Lisa Lapin argued that the mailing "did not contain any advocacy supporting or opposing any candidate." and "is nonpartisan and does not endorse any candidate or party.", there still exists possibility of adverse events. For example, this mailing could disturb or even irritate some vulnerable voters so we need to screen them out to reduce the probability of adverse events. Further, similarly to what already happened, the study might drive a part of the crowd complaining or alter the election outcomes. Thus, counseling or other psychological treatment is necessary to prevent such severe cases. Moreover, researchers did not take the impact on non-participants and social systems into consideration. Since 102,780 voters is a relatively big number, a system drift might occur and affect the study result. This systematic drift shoule be considered when designing the study. Last but not the least, to achieve a favorable balance, this study could have been enriched by people who do not have specific expertise in order to avoid group-think.

####3. Justice

In the Belmont Report, a brief definition of justice is that justice ensures the risks and benefits are distributed evenly in a population. The experiment proposed is to study whether people who have been given more information are more prone to vote. However, from their behavior that the population caused Linda McCulloch to file a formal complaint, it turns out that the 102,780 voters in Montana is a vulnerable population. If the study came out, it would have benefited the society as a whole while at the cost of letting voters in Montana bear their dissatisfaction. Thus, the unevenly distributed benefits and risks make this research not align with the principle of Justice. Second, they did not inform participants ahead but conducted the research in secret and it is why it became so controversial later on. Overall, this study does not meet the principle of justice.

####4. Respect for law and public interest

This principle comes from the Menlo Report, which is comprised of two parts: 1) Compliance and 2) Transparency-based Accountability. The first terms means that researchers should comply with relevant laws and terms of service. The second requires researchers to clarify goals, methods and results and take their own responsibility. Researchers from Stanford and Dartmouth is said to violate "Montana campaign practice laws requiring registration, reporting and disclosure of independent expenditures.", by the Commissioner of Political Practices of the State of Montana, Jonathan Motl. Although this is still controversial, as Stanford spokeswoman, Lisa Lapin  pointed out "Stanford...does not believe any election laws were violated" along with other arguments, 
intention should not be used as an excuse for an form of violation of laws. Despite that, they also used the Great Seal of Montana without authorization. These two examples show that how do many researchers lack necessary knowledge of the law. 

### 2. Assume that the mailers were sent to a random sample of voters: under what conditions might this mailing have altered the outcome of the Supreme Court Justice election?

The hypothesis of this study is that people tend to vote if given more information. So the outcome could accept the hypothesis or reject the hypothesis. It could happen that when the number of people who consequently decided to vote after provided with more information is comparable to the original population. For example, 50,000 voters in 102,780 intended to vote but 20,000 more decided to vote after receiving mailers, while the later group's behavior is of great uncertainty and might has little in common with the original one. Besides, the way the mailers is designed could also alter the outcome of the Supreme Court Justice election. As mentioned, the Supreme Court Justice election is a non-partisan election, but the mailer is designed to include Barack Obama and Mitt Romney as comparisons. People's decision might be implicitly influenced by the politicians, resulting a skewed voting for some specific candidates.

### 3. Does this change your assessment of the research design? If so, how?

It does not change much my assessment. In terms of ethical part, this change cannot do much with the intrinsic ethical flaws of the study design because they only changed the sampling method in order to compensate some realistic bias. However, the adjusted method is still problematic for its representativeness. As mentioned, Democratic voters turnout is supposed to be much lower, but they send mailers to people from a range of political positions from liberal to centrist. The result could be largely skewed if people in Montana area are mainly centrist and thus alter the election outcome. A better statistical approach is to divide subjects into more subgroups until they can well represent the voter distribution in the States.

### 4. Does this change your assessment of the research? If so, how?

Researchers now defend the beneficence of their research from arguing that "neither judicial race had been closely contested in the primary". This shows their endeavor in analysis of rick/severity of events but other aspects, according to Salganik's four principles, remain the same. It did not show respect for persons, reduce the probability of adverse events, analyze the impact on non-participants and social systems, ensure risks and benefits are well distributed or exhibit respect for law and public interest. Afterall, the research is still ethically problematic, using Salganik's four principles of ethical research.

### 5. Does this change your assessment of the research? If so, how?

We do not change our assessment. Although the election was not that close, it only imply that the election is less likely affected by our research. The election result can be used for verification of risk analysis of this study. However, it again did not change much in terms of its ethical problems, including respect for persons, beneficence, justice and respect for law and public interest. We cannot not accept an unethical study just because of its persuasive result.

### 6. Does this change your assessment of the research? If so, how?

Adam Bonica's company CrowdPAC not only used the same data in Montana election for a profit, but also provides tools to organize communities and fund political campaigns for a fee, which could indicate something even worse than our assessment. If Adam Bonica had used a part of or the whole study for his company's or his own profit, it would have been a greater violation of Montana law, which "requiring registration, reporting and disclosure of independent expenditures." as well as public interest. It would have became the situation that the study benefits a small group, i.e., researchers and Adam Bonica's company CrowdPAC, while harming the public interest a lot. So this does not change our assessment but indicates possible violation of laws and justice. 

### 7. What, if anything, would you have done differently if you were the principal investigators? How would you have designed the study if you were interested in exploring whether additional information increases voter turnout in nonpartisan races?

#### Respect for persons

In practice, whenever possible, researchers should have gotten some form of consent from participants before the study began or after it ended. The key is that participants should be provided with relevant information in a comprehensible format and then autonomously decide whether or not to participate. Meanwhile, individuals with diminished autonomy should receive additional protection. By following these two rules, we could say that we align with the principle of respect for persons.

#### Beneficence

This includes both a risk/benefit analysis and keeping our research on the right balance. In digital age, the most challenging part is informational risk, which could be economic, social, psychological, or even criminal. One way that we could decrease informational risk is “anonymization” of data. In this study, we could send mailers with non-specific names such as dear neighborhood to avoid a leak of personal information. Also, researchers could have attempted to use efficient statistical methods (Bit by Bit Chapter 4) to minimize the number of subjects to prevent the severity of events such as altering the outcome of Montana election. Moreover, outsiders could be invited to this research to prevent "group-think" and to maintain a balance between risks and benefits.

#### Justice

Justice requires that the study should not only benefit researchers for their academic interest, but also share the result with the public, especially Montanan people. And, if possible, appropriate compensation is needed for Montanan participants. By ensuring the risks and benefits of the research study is well distributed, we can meet the principle of justice.

#### Respect for law and public interest

We have to make sure that we identify relevant laws, contracts and terms of service before conducting our research and obey these regulations during our study. We could hire a lawyer if necessary since many researchers cannot grasp all the dos and don'ts in a short time. Besides, we want to make sure our study as transparent as possibile. For example, we should ensure and claim that although Adam Bonica owns a for-profit company relative to this study, he is involved in this study not for his own or his company's profit but for acedemic interest and public interest. 

Thus, we can make sure our study an ethical one by following Salganik's four principles.
