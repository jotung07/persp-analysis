# The ethics of the Montana election experiment (10 points)
## By Cooper Nederhood

> This assignment is based heavily on exercise 6.14 in Matthew Salganik's [*Bit by Bit*](http://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/ethics/ethics-activities/).


In a short paper (1200-1500 words):

1. Assess this study using Salganik's four principles of ethical research.

The Montana study violates the principle of Respect for Persons because it purposefully relies on deception to achieve its research goal. The researchers are attempting to influence the behavoir of voters, therefore violating the principle that individuals are autonomous and must be allowed to make their own decisions free from the meddling of outside forces. Individuals receiving the mailer neither consented to the study nor were informed that they were participating in a study. The research target of increased voter turnout is beneficial to society which mitigates the violation of the principle, but, as Salganik states, even when intervening in a non-harmful way the participants should be able to decide for themselves. Further, while increasing voter turnout is not bad, the act of voting is a pillar of any democratic society and manipulating that process, even in an inocous way, could be very damaging. However, in our current age of massive political PACs and money in campaigns, it is incredibly naive to think that voters are not already being manipulated by outside forces so perhaps having the manipulation coming from a force with hopefully pure research intentions is preferable.

However, a single violation of a principal does not necessarily doom a study to being entirely unethical. Ultimately whether or not a study is ethical is a complex cost-benefit analysis. Because research interests that rely on deception will always violate the principle of respect for persons they need to ensure that this violation is minimized and that the benefits to society outweigh the costs to the violated individuals. The individuals receiving the mailer could feel that their near sacred right of voting was violated. However, I believe the greater cost of the study is that the mailer projects a partisan divide on the election that is intentionally non-partisan. Politics in the United States is, to the detriment of the society, incredibly partisan. The judicial branch, as a nuetral arbiter of the law, should exist outside of the liberal-conservative dichotomy which is probably why the election is non-partisan in the first place. Including presidential candidates on the scale projects Supreme Court justices into this partisan political world. The researchers did take steps to minimize the cost to society. Indicating that the mailer does not support any particular candidate and is purely for informational purposes does mitigate the harm to society. However, the mailer does give a sense that it is an official government document rather than something created by an outside party. This increases the level of deception, perhaps unecesarily. 

The principle of justice is somewhat violated because the benefit to society, the increased understanding of voter behavior, occurs at the expense of only Montanan society. However, the study does not target specifically repressed groups and the participants, while not consenting to the study, are not vulnerable and needing of enhanced protection. 
The Montana study violates the respect for law because it was not submitted to the Stanford Institutional Review Board, which, as the university's apology letter states, "is a clear violation of university policy." This failure to follow accepted procedure casts the explanation that the confusion was a result of misunderstanding rather than intended disinformation into doubt. If the researchers were wholly confident in their design and the cost-benefit of the study, they probably would have gotten the blessing of the IRB. Overall, this study could have been designed in a way that achieves the research goal but better minimizes the costs to society.

1. Assume that the mailers were sent to a random sample of voters: under what conditions might this mailing have altered the outcome of the Supreme Court Justice election?

The mailer is designed to increase voter turnout. By randomly distributing the mailer, the increased voter turnout on each side could offset. However, if the degree to which a voter is effected by the mailer is correlated with the candidate they support then the effect may not be offsetting. For example, if the supporters of candidate A are likely to stay home on voting day, they could be more affected by mailer than candidate B's voters who are highly likely to vote.


1. In fact, the mailers were not sent to a random sample of voters. According to a report by Jeremy Johnson (a political scientists who assisted in the investigation), mailers "were sent to 64,265 voters identified as likely liberal to centrist leaning in Democratic leaning precincts and 39,515 voters identified as conservative to centrist in Republican leaning precincts. The researchers justified the disparity between Democratic and Republican numbers on grounds that they anticipated turnout to be significantly lower among Democratic voters." Does this change your assessment of the research design? If so, how?

Because the research design focuses on increasing voter turnout, to ensure that the result of the election is not changed the researchers need to take steps so that the effect for each candidate is similar, thus having no net effect. As discussed, even if the mailers are randomly and evenly distrubted across candidate supporters, the effects may not be offsetting if they are affected differently by the mailer. However, by sending roughly twenty thousand more mailers to democratic voters it makes it highly probable that the net effect on the election is in the more liberal candidate's favor. Increasing voter turnout is a normatively desirable result which mitigates the violation of participants autonomy, but unevenly dispersing mailers changes this from increasing voter turnout to increasing democratic support. A key component to the researchers's defense was the non-partisan neutral nature of the mailer but the uneven distribution casts doubt on this neutrality.

1. In response to the investigation, the researchers said that they picked this election in part because "neither judicial race had been closely contested in the primary. Based on an analysis of the 2014 primary election results in the context of previous Montana judicial elections, the researchers determined that the research study as designed would not change the outcome of either contest." Does this change your assessment of the research? If so, how?

Choosing a non-competitive election greatly mitigates any potential influence the study could exhert on the result. It also shows that the researchers were aware of the potential risks of their experiment and took actions to minimize those risks. However, it also reduces the benefit of the study because perhaps the voting behavior in a relatively non-competitive election is fundamentally different than behavior in a competitive election. Perhaps our ability to generalize the findings to other elections is hampered by this selection. However, the ethicality of any study is essentially a cost-benefit analysis and the reduction in risks is probably greater in magnitude than the reduction in beneficience, so overall this decision makes the study more ethical.


1. In fact, the election turned out to be not particularly close.

    | Candidates               | Votes received | Percentage |
    |--------------------------|----------------|------------|
    | Supreme Court Justice #1 |                |            |
    | W. David Herbert         | 65,404         | 21.59%     |
    | Jim Rice                 | 236,963        | 78.22%     |
    | Supreme Court Justice #2 |                |            |
    | Lawrence VanDyke         | 134,904        | 40.80%     |
    | Mike Wheat               | 195,303        | 59.06%     |
    
    Does this change your assessment of the research? If so, how?

Confirmation that the election results were not materially altered is a significant step in the ethics of the experiment. While the mailer caused confusion in voters it did not change the outcome. However, the broader effects regarding how the public views the voting procedure and the integrity of the democratic process can still be harmed. These more abstract effects cannot easily be quantified.

1. One of the principal investigators for the Montana election study ([Adam Bonica](http://web.stanford.edu/~bonica/)) is also the co-founder of [CrowdPAC](https://www.crowdpac.com/), a for-profit company which "calculates objective scores for political candidates showing their overall political position" using, in part, the same data used to score the judicial candidates in Montana. While a source of objective information for voters to make decisions about candidates, CrowdPAC also provides tools to organize activist communities and fund political campaigns (all for a fee). Does this change your assessment of the research? If so, how?

A sinnacle view of this study could see it as merely an advertisement for Adam Bonica's company rather than a genuine pursuit of knowledge. However, a researcher is seeking a publication and to increase their status as an academic so the pursuit of material gain is never fully removed from the situation. 


1. What, if anything, would you have done differently if you were the principal investigators? How would you have designed the study if you were interested in exploring whether additional information increases voter turnout in nonpartisan races?

The most damning piece of evidence against the researchers is their failure to seek input from Stanford's review board. It makes it seem like they knew what they were doing was potentially dubious and they wanted to subvert that process. So first I would have submitted the design to the IRB. I would also have evenly distributed the mailers. I expect that the variable cost of each mailer is relatively low, so cost should not be prohibitive. Further, the mailer itself looks too much like an official government document. Confusion could have been avoided by making it more clear that the mailer was meant just for information and not partisan. For example, removing the Montana seal would have lessened the confusion and been less manipulative. Getting informed consent is impossible in such a study, but researchers could have easily sent a follow up letter after the election explaining their research. A possible side effect of the study is the erosion of the public's confidence in the voting process, but by sending a follow up letter explaining the motivations you involve the public more directly in the research, empowering them and mitigating any ill effects from the violation of their autonomy.
