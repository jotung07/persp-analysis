Improving a journal article
---------------------------

### Look through a recent issue of a journal in your field. Find a paper that you think could have been reformualted as a human computation project. How would you formulate the data collection as a human computation project? How might this improve the study?

Coming from a biology background, my field can roughly be considered to be biological psychology. After looking through recent biological psychology journals, I found a 2017 paper titled "Emotion-Color Associations in the Context of the Face" (Thorstenson et al., 2017). Emotion detection in human faces is a frequently study topic in biological and social psychology, as emotion expression is used heavily in human signaling to perceive information about affective state in others. This paper looked at emotion-color associations in the context of the face and found a pattern consistent with physiological and psychological models of emotion. As a specific example of their results, participants decreased facial redness for disgust, fear, and sadness, but decrease facial yellowness for just fear and sadness. These lines of research find importance in the common use of color in culture, such as visual-expressive communications (i.e. emoticons), and also in underlying physiological processes (e.g. blood flow) that modify skin color appearance in different ways across cultures.

The reason I believe this project, and perhaps other projects that map variables onto human emotional states, would benefit from human computation is because of the human ability to detect emotional states. The data in these project requires ratings of percentages of defined emotional states (e.g., disgust, anger, sadness, frustration, confusion, etc.) based on images of human faces that vary in expression. I would reformulate data collection by crowdsourcing human workers to identify emotional states and then map coloration onto them. The key in this study is averaging on scales amongst emotional states, so accuracy would be gained in labeling affective states to facial expressions by having thousand of human raters rank and identify these states. This would improve the study in that subjective ratings done by humans are the only way to measure something as subjective as facial emotive expressions. These ratings could obviously be done by a small team of research assistants, but the weakness in this lies in the accuracy averaging out amongst the labeling of emotional states to human faces.

The reaons I think that human computation could improve this line of reason goes back to one of the important aspects of human computation as a collaborative methodology: human computation is meant to be incredibly helpful with simple tasks that can be quickly and easily done by human workers, but these simple tasks can be complicated for computers. Computers may have the ability to measure aspects such as colors, by mapping redness or yelloness onto a digital scale. However, emotive states and empathy reading and perception often tag onto a skill that is very much *human* in nature. It is highly studied in terms of these empathy reading differences across cultures. To find slight differences in emotive facial ratings across cultures in humans is a task that must be done with human subjective ratings. This is a task that benefits from human computation in that imaging rating, especially with a topic as subjective and *human* in nature as emotive facial expressions, would highly benefit from a large number of human raters, creating more accurate average estimates of percentages of emotive states; thenn, the authors could then more accurately map into other variables such as colorimetric spectrums.
