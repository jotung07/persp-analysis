### 1. Assess this study using Salganik's four principles of ethical research
In this section, I assess the Montana Election Experiment using four principles of ethical research.

#### Respect for Persons
According to the _Respect for Persons_ principle, the Montana Election Experiment fails to adhere to ethical research standards since the researchers did their experiment without participants' consent or awareness.

In the experiment, the researchers directly sent mailers to 102,780 registered voters in Montana to test whether voters with more information are more likely to vote. When conducting the experiment, the researchers did not inform the registered voters about the experiment, and they did not receive the participants' consent of participation. Thus, they did not treat participants as autonomous, and they violate the _Respect for Persons_ principle.

#### Beneficence
According to _Beneficence_ principle, researchers should do a risk/benefit analysis and then a decision about whether the risks and benefits strike an appropriate ethical balance (Bit by Bit). From my perspective, the researchers involving Montana Election Experiment violated this principle.

Firstly, while the experiment seems to have no direct negative effects on the participants, it can have some bad effects on non-participants and social systems. First of all, it is clear that such experiment may change the outcome of the Supreme Court Justice election. On the one hand, the information they offered might change the mind of those registered voters and they might change their choice on whom to vote for. On the other hand, if more information does rise the likelihood of voting, the election outcome might also be altered. In this case, we assume that information they provided have no effect on the voters' choice (as they stated, the information relied upon public information). However, if the turnout increases, then some registered voters who would not go to vote are now voting. In this way, the election outcomes might be changed. If the election outcome was altered, then this experiment is actually having negative effects on the society.

Secondly, when conducting the experiment, the researchers sent mailers with the Great Seal of the State of Montana. Such unauthorized use of Great Seal of Montana might also have negative effects on the social system there.

#### Justice
According to Bit by Bit, the _Justice_ principle implies that an experiment is injustice if one group in society bears the costs of research while another group reaps its benefits. In particular, the Montana election experiment might violate this principle in the following two ways.

The experiment tries to reveal whether more information would increase the likelihood of voting, in this way, the benificiers are the whole society. However, since the election outcome may be altered, the citizens at Montana and the candidates are actually facing the possible adverse events and they bear the burdens of this research. In this way, the risks and benefits of this research are not fairly distributed and then this research violates the principle of _Justice_.

#### Respect for Law and Public Interest
It is obvious that this research put itself under the risk of violating laws in Montana. Although the research team stated that "the research was not affiliated with any political party, candidate or organization, and was not intended to influence any race" and their information "relied upon public information about who had donated to each of the campaigns", the Commissioner of Political Practices of the State of Montana still judged that the researcher violated Montana campaign practice laws. Also, the unauthorized use of the Great Seal of Montana violates Montana state law. Furthermore, have the research passed the Institutional Review Board (IRB) process at both Dartmouth College and Stanford University is still a question. Before conducting a research, the researchers should think about IRB process at very least.

### Question 2. Under what conditions might this mailing have altered the outcome of the Supreme Court Justice election
In this section, I state two conditions under which the election outcome might be altered.

First of all, even they selected sample randomly, if the information they provided had impact on voters' attitude towards certain candidates, the election outcome might be altered. In this condition, I assume that the election turnout stays unchanged (I will discuss the situation that the experiment changes the turnout in the following paragraph). For example, let's assume candidate "A" will receive 51% votes and candidate "B" will win 49% votes if no additional information was conducted. If the information provided makes 2% voters to change their mind and they decide to vote for candidate "B", then "B" will receive 51% votes and "A" will only receive 49%, and thus the election outcome is altered.

Secondly, even if the information they provided is unbiased to any of the candidates, the election outcome could be changed since the election turnout might be changed. As we can see, the research question of this experiment is "whether voters who are given more information are more likely to vote". Thus, if more information does make more voters to vote, then the election outcome can be different. To make it clearer, if the overall preference of the "additional voters" (voters who won't vote if they don't receive additional information but now vote) is different from the original voters (who will vote even if they didn't receive additional information), then we can possibly have different election outcomes.

### Question 3. Does this change your assessment of the research design? If so, how?
This design will to some extent attenuate my concern on how this research violates the _Beneficence_ principle. However, this research still seems "unethical" from other perspectives.

A central concern of the critiques toward this research is that it may alter the election outcome. By selecting sample in the new way, the researchers take the possible adverse event into account and they are actually trying to minimize the probability of such event to happen.

In this experiment, the sample selection process is not random. In fact, the number of mailers sent to likely liberal to centrist voters is roughly two times of the number of mailers sent to conservative to centrist. The researchers said they did so because they anticipate the turnout to be significantly lower among Democratic voters. In this way, the number of "additional voters" (voters who won't vote if they don't receive additional information but now vote) of Democratic and Republican might be quite close. Thus, the probability that the election outcome will be changed is reduced. However, I may still blame this research for it’s not ethical if we assess it from other perspectives.

### Question 4. Does this change your assessment of the research? If so, how?
Similar to my answer to question 3, such explanation reduced my concern of violation to _Beneficence_ principle, but the experiment still violates other principles.

The researchers stated that they did the experiment in Montana based on an analysis of the 2014 primary election results. Such design further reduced the concern that the election outcomes will be altered. That is, the experiment might have little effects on the social system. In this way, the experiment might have little negative effects on the society.

However, to make the experiment ethical, the researchers should still get consent from the voters before they actually started. Also, they should consult some ethicists or non-researchers to help them decide whether the research is ethical.

### Question 5. Does this change your assessment of the research? If so, how?

The post-hoc results suggest that the experiment is very unlike to change the election outcome. However, I may reiterate that the experiment still  violates the ethical principles.

Let me put the violation of _Respect to Persons_, _Justice_ and _Respect for Law and Public Interest_ aside, and focus on _Beneficence_. The key question here is "Does no post-hoc negative effects guarantees the uprightness of a research?" My answer is, no. Following this logic, even the election outcome is not altered by this experiment, the research itself is still unethical from _Beneficence_ perspective.

Why no post-hoc negative effects cannot guarantee the uprightness of a research? We may need to rethink why we need ethical research standards. The primary reason we need it is to guarantee nobody will be harmed by conducting certain research. And when thinking about whether a research is ethical or not, the first thing to consider is whether it'll bring about unwanted negative effects to the participants and the society. In that way, if a research can have some severe negative effects, we may need to rethink whether we should conduct it. In the context of Montana election experiment, the research may have some negative impact on the society. Thus, even if it turns out to have no impact on the election outcome, the experiment may not be able to render it ethnical.

### Question 6. Does this change your assessment of the research? If so, how?
Such information even makes me further believe that the research is unethical, since it further violates the _transparency based accountability_ principle in _Respect for Law and Public Interest_.

According to transparency-based accountability principle, researchers need to clarify the goals, methods, and results at all stages of their research process. However, being a co-founder of a for-profit company, whose main goal is to "provides tools to organize activist communities and fund political campaigns" may make the goal of this research blurred.

More importantly, the CrowdPAC is a for-profit company, how can the researchers guarantee the data used to score the judicial candidates in Montana provided by CrowdPAC is objective? If the researchers fail to justify the objectiveness of the data, then the research will be more unethical.

### Question 7: Redesign the Experiment
I would talk about how I would redesign the experiment from two perspectives to make the experiment meet the research ethnic standards.

#### More ethical from _Respect for Persons_ perspective
To improve the experiment, I would write on envelope stating that "you're receiving this mail because you're invited to participate an experiment conducted by Dartmouth and Stanford University". Also, in the mailer, I will send all selected voters a brief introduction about our experiment, tell them what might be the possible risks if participating the experiment. Most importantly, I will tell the voters who received our mail that "Do not read the information we provided if you do not want to participate this experiment". Although we can still not receive consent directly from participants, however, by doing so, we at least make the voters aware that they are participating an experiment, and they will read the information we provide only after they agree to participate the experiment.

#### More ethical from _Beneficence_ and _Justice_ perspective
If I were conducting the research, I would reduce the sample size to avoid possibility that the experiment will affect the election outcomes. As we can see, the sample size is larger than 100000, and the total number of voters about just 300000. The sample size is just too large so that the current experiment might be blamed for the possibility of changing election outcome. To avoid such concern, I may do this survey with a relatively smaller sample. To guarantee the precision and external validity of my experiment, I may improve the sampling methods and do some matchings.

Also, I would consult some non-researchers and ethicists to help me judge whether my experiment is ethical before I actually start.

#### More ethical from _Respect for Law and Public Interest_ perspective
To make the experiment more ethical, I would first consult the Montana government for their advice. The researchers are not able to understand all laws of Montana, so the best way to prevent any legal issues is to consult the government officers for advice. Also, I would avoid using the Great Seal of the State of Montana to further avoid any violation of laws.

In these ways, I think I could make the experiment more ethical.

#### Other ways to do this research
Finally, I want to state that if I were to explore whether additional information increases voter turnout in nonpartisan races, I may not conduct experiment to test my hypothesis although it’s a relatively easy and straightforward way. If I were to do the research, I may choose to use observational data combined with some quasi-experiment research design.  For example, some states may change laws and requiring more information disclosure from the candidates, which might allow voters to have more information. Or we can imagine the use of Internet and social media platform may help provide more information to voters, and all these “external shocks” provide researchers with good chances to use observational data and quasi-experiment design to detect causal effects.
