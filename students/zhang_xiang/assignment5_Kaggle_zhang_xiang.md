## Perspective on Computational Analysis
#### Assignment 5: Kaggle Open Call Projects
#### Name: Xiang Zhang

### Name of the project on Kaggle: **Porto Seguroâ€™s Safe Driver Prediction**

### Goal of the competetion
In this competetion, participants are required to build a model to predict the probability that a driver will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year.

### What would you have to do to make a submission
Basically, this competetion is about using observational data to make a prediction. Furthermore, the agent requires the competetors to use machine learning methods to make prediction. Thus, to make a submission, I will use the data provided by them, build a machine learning model, calibrate the model and then make a submission.
