### Introduction
Accompanying with its economic bloom in the past forty years, the air quality in China continued getting worse. According to World Health Organization Database, 28 China cities are listed in "The List of most polluted cities" in 2016 (WHO). On the one hand, air pollution is a main risk to human health (for example, Ebenstein et al. 2017), on the other hand, the adverse effects of environmental degradation on human well-being provide a major rationale for pollution control (Welsch, 2006). Thus, it is important to study how, and to what extent that air pollution affect people's subjective well-being.

While this question is extremely important, evidence is scant on how air quality can influence human well-being. On top of it, the lack of data prevents researchers from studying this important issue. Although some survey data on people's self-reported well-being is available, however, such surveys do not directly ask what are the causes of depression (or unhappiness). Thus, researchers cannot draw clear causal relationship between air quality and human well-being. Also, the sample size of these surveys is relatively small, we can see no geographical distribution of the effects of air pollution on subjective well-being, which makes it difficult for researchers to give any policy suggestions.

In this research proposal, I propose a survey study which uses digital-enhanced technology (amplified asking using digital trace and online wiki-survey) to better justify how air pollution can affect people's subjective well-being (happiness).

### Introduction to Digitally-enhanced Survey Method and Data
In this section, I will first introduce the way in which I collect data. Then in the "Survey Design" subsection, I will briefly introduce the survey design and how I conduct my survey in a wiki-survey form.

#### Data Collection Method
There is a very big whether application "Whether Master" ("Tianqitong", in Chinese) in China. The main function of this application is to provide weather prediction and air quality information to its users. According to a third-party report, the total number of subscribers of the application has reach 380 million in 2017.

A good feature of this application is that it has a platform for its users to post something (the function of this platform is quite like Facebook), which provides me with a great chance of posting survey questionnaire and apply wiki-survey form to do the survey. To do the survey, I can just post a link to my questionnaire on that platform. By doing so, people can either participate the survey and share the link with others. Also, since it's an app on smartphones, then I can access the real-time location information of the respondents when they're filling the questionnaire. Finally, I will make use the "Active Users Map" offered by the application. By doing so, I can apply amplified asking method which takes advantage of digital-enhanced survey method.

#### Survey Design
Conceptually, my survey will be composed of three different sections. The first section will be about some basic demographic information (e.g. gender, age group) of the respondent. The second section will be about the measure of subjective well-being. and the third part will ask respondents about whether the air quality influenced their subjective well-being.

In the second section, I will offer some statements about subjective well-being, and ask the respondents to answer how they agree with my statement. For example, I will offer a statement "I do not think that the world is a good place", and the respondents may choose from "Strongly disagree", "Moderately disagree", "Slightly disagree", "Slightly agree", "Moderately agree" and "Strongly agree".

In the third section of my survey, I will use the "Wiki-survey" form introduced in Bit-by-bit, which allows me to hybrid closed and open questions in my survey. The data collection process is described below. First, notice that I asked respondents about their subjective well-being in the second section of the survey. Now, I will print their answer on the screen saying that, for example, "You choose to STRONGLY AGREE with the Statement that _I do not think that the world is a good place_", and then ask them _Do you think the air quality at the place where you live affect your choice?_ and offer them three options YES/NO/I DON'T KNOW. If they choose YES, then they will be presented with a pair of ideas on why air quality drives them choosing YES, and they will be asked to choose from them. Finally, after they make their own choice, they will be provided with another group of ideas and asked to choose ideas they agree. This process will continue until the respondents says "My choice is not listed". During the process, the respondents can choose to add their own thoughts and break out of the process at any time. In this way, I can collect more opinions and ask questions in both open and close ways.

### Justification of the Research Design
#### What about the survey makes it digitally-enhanced?
The digital-enhanced nature of my survey can be shown in three different aspects.

First of all, by conducting such survey, I am actually using the "amplified asking" method, which combines survey questions from a sample with digital traces from many people. In the survey, I know the real-time location of the respondents. Then by combining the location of these respondents with the "Active Users Map" offered by the social platform (An aggregated map showing the information of the geographical distribution of all active users during a given period of time), I can better draw inference to the full population.

Secondly, posting my questionnaire to such a large application makes my survey accessible to more individuals and it helps enlarge my sample size with extremely low cost. In traditional survey, the cost of each sample is extremely high, however, by conducting survey using internet, I can access more individuals with very low cost.

Thirdly, my survey makes use of support from the internet and webpage technologies. Through this way, I can conduct a wiki-survey, which allows me to take advantages of both open and close survey questions. By doing a survey in wiki-survey form, I can obtain rich information from my respondents and code their answers easily.

#### How would a survey be better than an observational study using found data
My survey will be better than other observational study using found data in mainly three ways.

Firstly, since the question I'm trying to answer is about people's internal states (how air quality affects their subjective well-being), the best to learn about it is asking individuals directly. Although we may have chances to observe air quality within a certain location and the general happiness of the residents there, there is no way to use traditional observational data to draw clear link on whether air pollution will affect one's happiness.

Secondly, due to the use of internet, I could obtain a much larger number of observations compared with the found data used by traditional observational study. Implicitly, larger sample size means more information, and in this way, I can take advantage of big data. For example, I can draw clearer causal inference and increase the statistical power.

Last but not least, it helps me to access hard-reach population. For example, some population might be very cautious about their own privacy and they may reject your survey request if you do the survey offline (which is a data source of many observational study). However, this survey taken in digital form will largely alleviate their concerns so that I could reach those hard-reach population.

#### What are potential sources of error in your survey, and how will you minimize that error?

One potential source of the error in my survey is the sample selection bias (errors from sample representativeness). Since I am going to use the information from my sample to make inference to the whole population, then if the respondents are not representative to the whole population, I will get biased estimation. In my research, the whole population are all residents in China, in this context, one may argue that the population who often use internet is quite different from the population who do not, and further, their preference or attitudes toward how air quality may affect their subjective well-being might be different. However, this concern could be attenuated by the fact that the number of internet-users is pretty close to the number of whole population in China, which means that people have similar access to internet. Also, I may use the available information to do some weighting in order to justify that my estimation is robust.

The second possible source of error is the measurement error of my survey. This source is actually composed of two components. The first possible error may come from the way in which I ask questions. In fact, the way I ask questions really matters. In order to minimize errors from this channel, the statements I choose will come from standard physiological questionnaire and the choice I give will be standard psychological scale. The second kind or error comes from the non-response problem. Conceptually, the respondents may only answer a certain number of questions in the questionnaire. For example, respondents may leave the survey before they finished it and thus they only answer part of the survey. In this sense, I should be very careful in dealing with such cases. Two methods might be used to minimize such error. Primarily, a simple way is to eliminate samples who don't finish the survey. Alternatively, I may use some sort of weighting method to adjust for this kind of errors. For example, I may use a logit regression to first predict whether a respondent will quite the survey using her demographic information provided. After that, I can assign different weight to different respondents based on the prediction.
