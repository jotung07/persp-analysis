## 1. Assessment based on Salganik's 4 principles

        I) Respect for persons: It is questionable that researchers have shown sufficient respect for persons, since the study did not inform the receivers of the mailers comprehensively nor did them ask for Montanans’ consent beforehand. “Before the commissioner of political practices of the State of Montana” stated that the flyers “showed up” in mailboxes of residents, suggesting the unexpectedness of such flyers (page 1). Although the researchers stated in the mailers that the mailers were created for “a research project” (page 29), they did not include further disclosure. Although the purpose of flyers has been later explained by the institutions, this explanation took place after the residents had received the flyers and had interpreted them in another way (page 1). According to Salganik, respect for persons require that the researchers present comprehensive information that is relevant to the study, and that the participation should be voluntary, i.e., respect for persons require “informed consent”. \
        II) Beneficence: While there is no clear evidence suggesting that the research has injured the Montanans’ physically or mentally, the mailers might have already disrupted voting in the community. If this research really had influenced the voting outcome, then we could hardly assume that the principle of Beneficence has been fully followed. Like the Wikipedia example explained by Salganik, the act of sending these mailers might have had negative impacts on the community while not harming any voter as an individual. \
        III) Justice: There is no clear evidence in the short article suggesting that the research has not followed the principle of justice when we compare Montanans who received the flyers and those who did not, since it is not clear that the voters who did not receive the flyers have gained additional benefits. However, from the original article by Richman in 2015, we can see that Dan Schunar, a Californian political ethic expert, raised questions on the issue of Justice by implying that the researchers deliberately chose to send out mailers in Montana instead of California because they assumed Montanans were less politically intellectual (Richman). In that case, the researchers might have not followed the principle of justice. \
        IV) Respect for law and public interest: It is questionable that the researchers have shown sufficient respect for law and public interest. The Commissioner of Montana has stated that the researchers violated Montana campaign practice laws. Moreover, researchers’ unauthorized use of the Great Seal of Montana was controversial. Even if this action did not violate the state law, from the complaints of the residents, we can see that their use of the Great Seal has not respected public interest. Moreover, according to Salganik, respect for law and public interest includes transparency-based accountability, which requires clarity on the purposes, methods, and outcomes for each phase of research. However, the explanation on the flyer was vague and clarification was made after the Montanans had expressed their concerns, and therefore, the transparency-based accountability was not followed in this study. \
## 2. 	Conditions under which the results might be altered (Part I)

        The mailing might have altered there was a discrepancy between the ranking of candidates in the flyer and voters’ own opinions on the candidates, then the outcome might have been altered. Furthermore, if the mailers indeed had increased the number of voters, but the impact was not the same for Democratic voters and for Republican voters, the result might have been altered. If, for example, among those who originally would not have voted, there were more Democratic voters than Republican voters, then Democratic candidates might have a greater chance to win. \
## 3. 	Conditions under which the results might be altered (Part II)
	
        The researchers claimed that the discrepancy in number of flyers mailed to two groups of voters was intended to weight the difference in anticipated turnouts. However, this action has made me question the issue of justice and that of beneficence further. If Democratic voters indeed have a lower turnover, such weighting might be a justifiable action to obey the principle of justice. Nevertheless, there is no evidence that is solid enough to prove that Democratic voters were significantly less responsive to such voters’ information than Republican voters. If the flyers indeed raised the number of votes, the researchers have put Republicans to the disadvantage to Democrats by providing the information to more people in Democratic Precincts. The researchers might have intended the discrepancy for justice, but I cannot conclude that the principle of justice has been followed. \
## 4. Closeness of the Election (Part I)
    
    If the outcome was, in fact, similar to those in the past (similar outcome means a comparable percentage of votes), then I will be less likely to conclude that the study has altered the results or that the study has violated the public interest. However, lack of consent from participants cannot be overlooked.  \
## 5. Closeness of the Election (Part II)

	    Based on the result, I would like to further question the issue of justice in this study. From the copy of flyer, we could see that Jim rice was less conservative-leaning than W. David Herbert, and that Mike Wheat was on the more liberal side while Lawrence Van Dyke was on the more conservative side. From the percentage of votes received, we can see that for both positions, the more liberal-leaning candidate received a major percentage of vote. This result was not consistent with the claim made by the researchers that “neither judicial race had been closely contested”. While there is no direct evidence that the result was altered by the flyers, it is hard not to associate the discrepancy in number of flyers sent to Democratic leaning precincts and Republican leaning precincts, since more voters in Democratic leaning precincts received the flyer, which was likely to put Republican voters at disadvantage. \ 

## 6. Importance of CrowdPAC	

        The fact that Adam Bonica is also the co-founder of a for-profit company will also alter my assessment of the research. While there is no evidence that the tools to organize activist communities and to fund political campaigns are associated with the data used to score the judicial candidates, the company has used the data for its own scoring for political candidates. It is reasonable to raise a question on whether Adam Bonica would use the outcome and the data from this research for its tool design. Since the research itself has raised complaints among Montanans, I would view this research as benefiting some groups (the company collects monetary benefits, and the activists have more tools) while causing disruptions among other groups (Montanans). Therefore, I would question the issue of justice. \
        
## 7. Improvements	

        First, for informed consent, I would send out mails informing Montanans that I was conducting a research and that I would send out flyers to some of them in the coming days. I would explain in my first letter the purpose and the methods of my research, and make it clear that the flyers had no political affiliation nor intention, rather than providing make-up explanation after sending out flyers. I would send out flyers afterwards, if no major concerns were raised by the residents. \
        Second, I would be more cautious about the State Law and I would want to make sure that I follow the necessary procedures and that I formulate my words in the flyers with caution. To avoid controversy, I would not use the Great Seal of Montana. \
        Third, while it might be true that voters with certain political views have a lower turnout, I would take caution in deciding the proportion of numbers of flyers sent to different precinct. I would not send more flyers to certain precinct based on a lower turnout, but rather, I would randomly distribute the flyers and weigh my calculation after I have collected my data. \
