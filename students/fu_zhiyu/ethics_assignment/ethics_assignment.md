# Discussion of the ethics of the Montana election experiment

## Assessment with four principles

### Respect for Persons

Though with some defects, this experiment, in general, did not violate the principle of Respect for Persons. What this experiment did is just sending mailers to registered voters. No other intervention is involved. The recipients had full autonomy to decide to read it or discard it; they also have full autonomy to vote or not.

Some may argue that using registered voters' mailing address without permission violated their privacy and they may not be willing to receive such mailers. As mandated by law, the voter records, including the mailing address, should be open data that can be accessed by the public. Specifically, in Montana, the Secretary of State ["shall furnish to any individual, for noncommercial use available extracts and reports from the statewide voter registration system."](https://sos.mt.gov/elections/voter_file) The disclosure of one's registration information is one of the obligations comes along with the right to vote, which voters were aware of when they registered. Hence the registration itself is a form of informed consent of receiving voting-related mails.

The experiment, however, can still be improved to stick to the principle better. The researchers can add a notification on the envelope or on the header of the mailer, stating that "This mailer contains information pertaining to the Montana Supreme Court Justice election, which, may or may not, affect your voting behavior." Then, recipients are at liberty to discard it if they are not willing to be exposed to more information.


### Beneficence

This experiment did not violate the principle of beneficence. What the researchers did is merely sending out mailers, which can not really harm the recipients (let us leave the harm to the public interest or to the justice for the next section). 


### Justice

Whether this experiment violated the principle of Justice depends on whether it was nonpartisan as claimed. If not, it would have benefited some certain candidates or parties and hurt others, and hence violated the principle of Justice. 

Two aspects of the research are vital in order to be nonpartisan: the unbiasedness of the information and the unbiasedness of the sampling. The information in the mailers are objective scores of the candidates on a political spectrum, calculated from "public information about who had donated to each of the campaigns". If it is indeed an objective index as claimed, the unbiasedness of the information can be guaranteed. We will revisit the unbiasedness of the objective scores in question 6. 

We will return to the discussion of the unbiasedness of the sampling in the question 3.

### Respect for law and public interest

The main controversial issue of this experiment is that it might have breached the law and harmed the public interest. Legally, there may be issues like whether this experiment should be treated as an independent expenditure, or whether the use of the Great Seal of the State of Montana is permissible in the experiment. However, these are technical problems for lawyers. Let us set aside the legal issue for the moment and stick to the discussion of public interest here. The public interest of a voting is that the results can truly reflect voters' opinions. Indisputably, this experiment must have affected the results of voting to some extent: Some people who may not have voted went to vote after the exposure to new information. The pivotal question is, whether such intervention impedes the expression of voters' opinions?

To answer that question, we need to consider two aspects of the experiment. First, whether this experiment is nonpartisan. The discussion for the principle of Justice can also be applied here since the justice of a vote is also the public interest. Another aspect is whether the experiment altered the final results of the election. If it did, the experiment is more controversial and sensitive. However, it does not necessarily imply that it is impermissible. If the results were altered because many who would not have voted went to vote, from the perspective of consequentialism, the experiment virtually facilitated the expression of voters' true opinions. Thus, it did not harm the public interest. Nevertheless, this opinion is controversial as some may argue that scientific research should keep neutral and not get involved in politics. If it did not alter the outcome, the experiment is safer, but it does not immediately justify the experiment. We still need to consider the other aspect, whether it is nonpartisan.

We will discuss this issue more concretely in the answers to question 4 and 5.

## Question 2

Suppose the treatment of mailers has an interaction with the recipients' political tendencies. For example, Republican-leaning voters are more likely to be encouraged by the mailers. Suppose without the experiment, the Democratic party candidates would have won the vote. However, under the treatment of mailers, more Republican-leaning voters went to vote, which may reverse the outcome.

## Question 3

Whether this kind of sampling is appropriate depends on the assumption of the treatment effect. If the treatment effect is proportional to the turnout, that is, lower turnout among Democratic voters also means they are less likely to be influenced by the mailers, then the larger sample in Democratic-leaning precincts can compensate such effect so that this experiment will add similar numbers of "marginal voters" for both parties. If, on the contrary, the treatment effect is homogeneous among voters, then higher sampling weight in Democratic-leaning precincts will add more "marginal voters" for the Democratic party, which breaches the principle of Justice as well as the respect for law and public interest. 

Actually, the assumption whether Democratic voters are less likely to be encouraged by the mailers is testable on their data. 

Without the access to the data, my guess is that given the Democratic voters are less willing to vote, it is plausible to assume they are more difficult to be encouraged by mailers. Therefore, it is appropriate to set different sample sizes for different precincts.

## Question 4

Such consideration means the researchers did follow the principle of Respect for law and public benefit. However, there are still chances where the previous Montana judicial elections is not a good predictor for that chosen election. It is still a little risky.


## Question 5

From the outcome, we can confidently argue that the outcome was not altered by the research. The maximum number of the difference of votes the research can possibly affect in theory was 64,265, the sample size in Democratic-leaning precincts, while the actual gap of votes between candidates were 171,559 and 60,399 respectively. Thus, it is impossible for the experiment to alter the outcome.

Given these facts, it is fair to argue that this experiment materially did not violate the principle of respect for law and public interest.


## Question 6

Whether my assessment will be changed depends on the transparency of the "objective scores". If the algorithm of calculating the objective scores is open-source and reproducible by others, then one of the principal being the co-founder of CrowdPAC is not an issue. However, if the calculation of "objective scores" is not public,  there might be some conflicts of interest. For example, one of the candidates of this election happens to be a client of CrowdPAC, then that principal investigator has the ability to provide biased scores for the experiment for the benefit of the client, which violates the third and fourth principles.


## Question 7

To summarize, according to the information above, this experiment followed four principles well. There may be some legal issues which we have not discussed in detail, but it at least did not harm the public interest. However, there are still some improvements I would have done if I were the principal investigator. First, as mentioned above, I would add a notification on the header of the mailer informing recipients of the content of this mailer. Second, I would use a smaller sample size. For the purpose of this study, a valid sample size of 1,000 will be sufficient for statistical methods. A smaller sample size can diminish the intervention to the outcome of the election. Third, I would make sure that the scores we are using in the experiment are open-source and reproducible by other researchers. Otherwise, I may not choose to collaborate with a co-founder of a for-profit company which provides the scores.
