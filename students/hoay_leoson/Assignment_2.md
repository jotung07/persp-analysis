## <a name = "introduction"></a>Introduction and Research Question 
Wikipedia is a tour de force in knowledge aggregation, community participation, and knowledge dissemination. In reference to my previous assignment([1]), studies have shown that Wikipedia is not only widely used in the academic context as an enabler of undergraduate level research, but also more importantly has an impact on scientific study at the frontiers. The implications of these results are neither trivial nor closed-ended - which is why I chose to focus my topic on the study of the possible corresponding correlation between Wikipedia articles and science communication. While the use of observational data was appropriate in estimating a correlation between content occurences in Wikipedia articles and science media, a survey methodology needs to approach this topic from a different angle. Previously, I wanted to find out if there was a significant correlation between occurences of new Wikipedia articles in a particular subfield of science and occurences of science media articles in the same subfield. With survey methods, the characteristics and internal states of the individuals that consume such media are rendered accessible. Thus, I propose a survey study that measures the self-reported exposure levels of individuals subscribed to popular science media sources to a particular field of study in science, and compare that with the changes in Wikipedia article density within the same scientific field of study.

This survey study attempts to determine if the effects of new Wikipedia articles are felt in the actual communication of science to the individual consumer of such science news media. While on the surface it may seem like a contrivance to survey the consumer, it is my understanding that higher article density does not necessarily translate into higher actual reach about a particular topic - paralleling the distinction in traditional print media between circulation and readership([2]). There may be many factors (such as how articles are clustered on a science media page), that contribute to determining actual reader exposure. In short, while the previous observational study seeks to establish the link between Wikipedia content and science media content, the proposed survey study seeks to establish the link between Wikipedia content and the self reported exposure of science media readers to content in the same field. Two questions are of primary interest:

1) Does reported exposure towards content within particular field of science in science media correlate with the changes in new Wikipedia article occurences within the same field of science?

2) Does the nature and significance of this correlation change between different modes of science media? (i.e. internet-based, television, subscription-based magazines)?
 

## <a name = "data"></a>Using Digitally-Enhanced Survey Data
The method to be employed in this survey study will be digitally-enhanced in two major ways. 

The first enhancement pertains to how the survey is delivered. In the observational study, I chose to omit television-based and print-based science media due to issues of complexity and redundancy. In this case, it will be beneficial to include both these modes of media, as it is much easier to locate our sample - "those who subscribe to and use popular science media" - through the science media outlets themselves, and send a print copy of the survey to the mailing address of subscribers to these programs. Noting that print surveys have a generally low return rate, a link will also be provided to an online survey which the participants can then complete more conveniently. The affordances of modern digital technology reveals its greatest benefits most in the process of surveying the group that reads online science media - since they cannot normally be traced. But using embedded surveys on the science media websites and online articles which perform in a manner similar to ecological momentary assessments will allow this sample population to be queried as well. 

The second enhancement follows the the principles of enriched asking, where the questions of the proposed study are enabled by combining the survey data of self-reported exposure to science topics to data drawn from Wikipedia in order to make comparisons. As with the previously proposed observational study, Wikipedia data is readily available from open-source databases such as Wikimedia and Wikidata. The data of interest for this study will be the new article occurences within a chosen set of subfields (e.g. Chemistry, Geology), over a specific period of time. 

#### Key parts of the survey
The core question in the survey will be a rank-ordering of topics that the participant has felt the most exposed to in science media for a particular week. These topics will be based on the chosen subfields of science that are selected for the study. The question will incorporate a "wiki" component, where participants can also fill in their own topics if so desired. In the analysis, these inputs will then be reclassified under an appropriate subfield, or classfied as a new data point.

One preemptive concern pertains to the asking period of one week - how might that work with the embedded surveys on the online news sites? The argument that this still works well is based on the assumption that many visitors to these online sites will drop in and out at all times, some of them with regularity and others not, and the responses to the embedded survey will be continuous enough to approximate a robust trend. Moreover, the analysis of Wikipedia content on the survey responses will be done by type-of-media, which eliminates the need to merge the data from the embedded surveys and those from the surveys sent in tandem with the other media types. 

Following the principles of EMA and in an effort to make the surveys as painless as possible, there will be very few questions aside from the core ranking question - perhaps some demographics fields (age, gender, SES, and so on), just in case interesting inferences can be made from those.  

In reference to Assignment 1 and the MIT Wikipedia study ([4]), the effects of new Wikipedia articles take a certain amount of time to "trickle down" to other domains, hence a suitable time frame should be selected in order to chart the effects and account for any lagged relationships. The MIT study utilised a time frame of approximately two years in the experimental portion of their study, and I propose that this study utilise a time period upwards of one year.


## <a name = "advantages"></a>Advantages 
The primary advantage of this study is that it takes advantage of enriched asking to combine survey and available sources of big data - Wikipedia data - in order to make comparisons. The always-on and "big" nature of the Wikipedia data allows for robust longitudinal analysis, while the survey portion allows one to ask questions regarding the states of human participants, which would not have been possible with observational data. 

The usage of embedded surveys allows for the survey to be disseminated in a convenient manner - while they are surfing the website - and also at an appropriate time - when they are reading or have just finished reading the website content - such that the content is still fresh in the participants' minds. It also dramatically reduces cost and increases the likelihood of participation as compared to traditional mailed surveys and offline formats. Participants are more likely to stay on the website and complete the survey, as they are already in a midst of being on the website and reading the content that is on the page. The ubiquity of the embedded survey also allows for mutiple instances of the survey to be delivered over a large time period, generating more data.


## <a name = "limitations"></a>Limitations (and potential strategies to address them) 
A possible source of error in this study arises from non-participants. As with any survey study, participation rate is often low, and measures are usually taken to ensure that a sufficient number of participants are included in the final data set. This study attempts to address this by making the survey succint, short, and less deterrent to potential participants. Given sufficient funding, an incentive can be provided to participants in the form of cash, a lucky draw, or vouchers.

Another source of error is potential data gaps that occur as a result of irregular traffic to websites, or certain participants identified as subscribers to a particular news source who do not participate regularly in the survey. If these gaps occur, the "wideness" of the gaps will first be determined, and an appropriate measure (such as chunking or moving averages) will be applied post-hoc.

The next source of error is probably the hardest to deal with: the exclusiveness of the sample population and the narrowness of the defined scope of scientific fields that are to be included in the study, which may result in certain representation errors. The latter is necessary in order to estimate a correlation with some level of specificity. It is definitely possible that a significant correlation might hold for a particular field of science, and not for another field that was not considered in the study. However, that is the conclusion that we will have to make - that the correlation holds for the fields of interest in this study, and that more parallel studies can be conducted to increase the generality of the findings. The exclusiveness of the sample population is also a result of the nature of the survey, which pinpoints individuals who regularly consume such science media - and at the same time excludes other segments of the population. However, subgroups can be identified in the larger population (e.g. high school attendees, university students), and specific studies can be done with those subgroups in mind.


## <a name = "conclusion"></a>Conclusion 
In closing, the proposed study leverages the survey framework in order to access information from human participants. While the methodology of this study seems orthogonal to that of the first observational study, its goals are parallel. The first attempts to confirm a relationship between Wikipedia content and science communication content, while this study attempts to expand that relationship to include actual exposure differences at the level of the average science-interested consumer of media.
