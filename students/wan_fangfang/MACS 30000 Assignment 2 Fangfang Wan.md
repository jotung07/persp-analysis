1. Introduction

​	In linguistics academia, "critical period hypothesis" (Wikipedia, 2017) was proposed by Lenneberg (1967) and is a dabated view stating that age-specific biological features largely define the learning difficulty, accent, fluency, near-native level and other characteristics of language acquisition, especially second language acquisition. Some existing studies (Johnson and Newport, 1989 and Johnson and Newport, 1991) have researched on individuals who studied English as a second (or third, etc.) language, and they provided evidence that English-immersion inception age is strongly correlated with several indicators of English acquisition level as a second language - the older age at which an individual started to be in a English-speaking environment, the more accent they bear, and the more difficulties they face in the learning process. However, due to limited tools in the old days, those studies were conducted on only a few number of individuals, and new digital tools that we are armed with nowdays have substantially enhanced our ability to conduct the research on more individuals and use digital tools to better test the "critical period hypothesis".

​	In this research, I plan to use new digital tools, rather than traditional methods, to answer this question: how does English-immersion inception age correlate with second language acquisition, while other factors are controlled? The exact definition and measurment of "second language acquisition" will be defined in detail in the following section. 

2. Research design

​	Salganik (2017) introduced revolutionary digital methods to conduct surveys in the new era with digital tools, which have enlightened my design of conducting the survey. To make up for the limited sample problem, I plan to utilize the largest online community - Facebook, to send out the survey. To simplify the sample-matching process due to non-probablistic sampling, which I will discuss later, I will limit the English speaking country to the United States. First, I will collect information of "place lived", "hometown" and "current city" of Facebook users. If "current city" locates in the United States, while at least one of "place lived" and "hometown" is in a non-English speaking country, then I will push a page to the news feed of those users, which is linked to a survey. I will use their demographic information to rule out individuals who have lived in a non-English speaking country, but are in fact English native speakers. To encourage users to participate in the survey, I will randomly assign 5% of the participants with $5 Amazon gift card. 

​	The survey will be divided into 2 parts - demographic information and audio recording, which are largely borrowed from the speech accent archive (George Mason University, 2017). 

​	Demographic information includes the following, and will be used as control variables, and age of English-immersion onset calculated from those inforamation is the key explanatory variable. 

- birth place
- native language
- age
- gender
- age of English onset
- education level
- duration of English-speaking country residence
- yearly family income per capita

​	Other than these basic demographic information, I will also collect subjective and psychological judgement information, and the rating scale is borrowed from Numeric Pain Rating Scale (Physiopedia). Those will be used as dependent variables. 

- How difficult is the English learning process for you? Rate from 0 to 10, where 0 = effortless, 10 = the most difficult thing that I've ever learned. 
- How close do you think your English ability is to your native language ability? Rate from 0 to 10, where 0 = I feel that English is just my another native language and 10 = extremely far from native language ability

​	In the audio recording part, borrowing the format from the speech accent archive (George Mason University, 2017), I will devise and provide a short English paragraph that included all phonetic alphabets that occur in English, based on the lastest version of International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) (International Phonetic Association, 2015). The recordings are then transcribed to IPA notations. 

​	Back to the research question - how does English-immersion inception age correlate with second language acquisition, while other factors are controlled? I will define and measure the level of "second language acquisition" by the following indicators:

- The two subjective and psychological questions mentioned above:
  - How difficult is the English learning process for you?
  - How close do you think your English ability is to your native language ability? 
- How close the participant's recording is to the accent of standard North American accent. 
  - To do this, I will first archive the IPA transcriptions of their audio recordings, and then use computer programming to decipher, for example, are their pronunciations of bilabial plosive ([p], [b]) different from the standard North American accent? If so, then add 1 to their variation score, which is initiated to 0. 

3. Digital research assessment and justification

​	Salganik (2017) described the new digital tools in the new era that we may utilize to conduct surveys, and pointed out strengths and pitfalls, and ways to avoid those pitfalls involved in the process. In this section, I will assess and justify the digital survey methods that I have proposed, using the points mentioned in Salganik (2017). 

​	Compared to previous studies on the critical period hypothesis, this research provides new insights into research on this topic due to digital tools it uses. First, previous studies were only conducted on a very limited number of participants. For instance, Johnson and Newport (1989) included only 46 individuals. The speech accent archive (George Mason University ) includes a somewhat larger participant pool (2463, by Oct 17, 2017), but it is still not considered as a big dataset. However, by pushing the survey to news feed on Facebook, the largest online community, and providing financial incentive ($5 Amazon gift card), I expect to acquire a significantly larger dataset. Additionally, survey results are collected online rather than traditionally paper or lab based. Therefore, online recording also becomes possible, by virtue of the new era of computer-administered digtal survey. Furthermore, using computational methods, I can easily compare the transcriptions to the standard North American accent, and evaluate variations of the participants' acutal pronunciation from standard accent, which can be cumbersome if it is executed manually under such large scale dataset. 

​	In this reseach scenario, using a survey dominates using observational data alone (the audio recording part may be considered as either survey or observational data, or both) because using a second language involves a significant psychological part - how diffcult individuals *feel* to learn a second language, and how individuals *feel* their mastery of a second language. For instance, as a learner of English as a second language, I personally feel that my accent may not seem too far from standard American accent, since I have lived in United States for several years, yet speaking English consumes significantly more energy than speaking my native tongue, and it is even far from a totally intuitional process as speaking my native language. Those unobservable mental feelings may not be easily captured by observational data, but executing a survey enables us to grasp those subjective feelings. Furthermore, even for the demographic information part, conducting surveys provides far more complete and accurate data than simply extracting observational data from Facebook profiles, due to the fact that it is usual for people to provide outdated or incomplete information on Facebook. Additionally, I can hardly get information about native language, age of English onset, etc. without conducting a survey, while survey can provide us with a broader range of basic information. The concept of "amplified asking" proposed by Salganik (2017) enhanced the completeness and accuracy of data collected.

​	However, there are some potential pitfalls originated from the research design. For example, there my exists representation error. The target population should be all individuals who have learned *any* second language and have lived in a country associated with that language for a significant length of time. However, I can hardly extract information I need about all individuals in the target population, even if I further limit the target population as individuals who was born in a *non-English* speaking country and have lived in the United States for a significant duration of time, so there may exist coverage error. One potential explanation for this coverage error might ascribe to different learning ability arised from different age distributions, so using sample collected from Facebook users my underestimate correlation between English-immersion onset age and second language acquisition ability. Furthermore, people who partipated in the survey may tend to have higher English ability, due to the response error originated from the possiblity that an individual who are not confident about his or her English ability tend to avoid this survey. Contrastingly, the financial incentive may attract more people with lower-income and thus also with poorer English ability. Therefore, this is a non-probablity sampling process, while the direction of non-probability is not even clear. However, as suggested in Salganik (2017), I can use sample-matching method to create a modified sample which matches the distribution of basic demographic information of the target population. To obtain information about our target population, and to simplify the process, I can control for the second language that I am insterested in - (north American) English, and cooperate with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement to extract information (including birth country, native language, age, gender, educational level, years lived in the United States, and yearly family income per capita) of people who have come to the United States for a significant duration of time for study, work, etc. With those information about target population in hand, I can select individuals from the raw sample so that the distributions of basic demographic information match those of target sample, thus enhancing the crediblity of resulted sample.
