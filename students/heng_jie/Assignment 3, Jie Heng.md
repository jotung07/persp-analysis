# An Experiment Exploring How to Improve High School Students’ Academic Achievement

## Introduction and research question

High school education is important as it helps students to prepare themselves for the society and college. A high-achiever is thought to be better prepared and more likely to be admitted by top universities. Which is the more suitable and efficient strategy for students to improve academic achievement? The answer to this question is the concern of students, parents and educators and researchers as well. 

There are three commonly used strategies to improve students’ academic achievement: reviewing knowledge, practicing challenging problems and previewing knowledge. For one, students may not have enough time to follow all the three stratigies. For another, the effects of the same strategy may have different effects on different students. For example, people might believe for high achievers, pratcticing challenging problems is more important than reviewing knowledge. This week, I would propose an experiment to compare the effects of three commonly used strategies on students with different academic performance.

My research questions are two folds: 

For American high school students
1. Do the three strategies: reviewing knowledge, practicing challenging problems and previewing knowledge have different effects on high achievers, moderate achievers and under achievers? 
2. Which strategy or the combination of the strategies are more efficient in improving the academic achievement for high achievers, moderate achievers and under achievers respectively? 

## Research funds and supports

This research will seek support from the United States Department of Education. The government will be interested in this research as the result of it could be helpful information for government to carry out reforms in education and is beneficial to the education of future generation.  

The research will also try to reach out private sectors to gain financial supports. The experiment will continue to use the application mentioned in the last survey proposal, which is specifically designed for this research, the funds will come from the advertisements on the app. 

## Experimental Design

The experiment will be a randomized controlled experiment and follow within-subjects design. Participants’ academic achievement will be compared with themselves before and after the treatment both in control and treatment groups. The research is expected to start in December of 2017 and will last for one years. Effects will be measured in 2018.

### 1. Participant recruitment
Letters will be sent to schools and centers from the United States Department of Education requesting their collaboration in the study. More than 10,000 ninth-year high school students are randomly selected from government, semi-government and non-government schools.
Permission from parents and students is secured before any data collected. They will be assured that all information will be kept confidential. 

**Pre-experiment survey**

Before the experiment conducts, a pre-experiment survey will be designed to gather information about potential participants' study habbits: whether students preview, review or do extra practive problems which are more difficult than the textbook. The survey will be done with the help of the school teachers. 

Only students who do not have the three habits: reviewing, previewing, doing hard practice problems will be included in this research.


### 2. Measurement
To measure students’ academic achievement precisely, a unified test will be designed for all participants. 

At the beginning of this research, and in the following year, participants will take exams based on the English and math textbook of grade 9 which will be of the same pattern which has been considered valid in the annual board examination. The tests will test students’ comprehensibility and quantitative analysis ability. For the validity of the test paper, the researcher will get it checked by the experts, who are involved in preparing question papers for the annual board examination. 

After the first test, students will be divided into three categories based on their academic achievement using Peterson & Colangelo’s method. Students will be judged to be academic high achiever (HA), moderate achiever (MA) and underachiever (UA). The HA category is defined as the 90th to 100th percentile, the MA category was defined as the 75th to 90th percentile, and the UA category is defined as the below 75th of the entire cohort based on the results of the school’s standardized academic assessment. 

Participants will take three tests in Februrary 2018, June 2018, December 2018 that based on the English and math textbook of grade 9. 

### 3. Follow-up surveys

As this research is a long-term research, the feedback from participants are quite important. We will conduct survey sent through the mobile app to gather participants suggestions and feedback about this research after the evaluation tests. 

### 4. Randomization of treatment
As students, especially those high achievers, may review, preview or do challenging problems in their spare time, their study habits will influe
they will be assigned to the following 16 groups and each group includes all three categories of students.

There will be eight conditions:

  * a control group.
  * a group that reviews knowledge.
  * a group that does challenging exercises.  
  * a group that preview knowledge.
  * a group that reviews knowledge + does challenging exercises.
  * a group that reviews knowledge + preview knowledge.
  * a group that does challenging exercises + preview knowledge.  
  * a group that reviews knowledge + does challenging exercises + preview knowledge.


### 5. Delivery of treatment 

The treatment will be delivered through a cell-phone app (the same app used in the previous survey). Participants will be asked to download the application. For students who do not have a smartphone, the researcher team will provide them with one. 

For students in groups that reviews knowledge, the app will provide a list of notes that cover all the basic knowledge students have learnt in the past week. Students are required to watch all the notes each week and finish a quiz testing their understanding of the knowledge. 

For students in groups that does challenging exercises, the app will provide five challenging exercises with solutions. Although the difficulties of these exercise are higher than the textbook, all exercises only test the knowledge for students have learned.

For students in groups that previews knowledge, the app will provide a list of notes that cover all the basic knowledge students will learn next week. Students are required to watch all the notes each week and finishing a quiz testing their understanding of the knowledge. 

All the notes and challenging problems will be designed by the research group with the help of experts from the United States Department of Education.

All the notes, quiz and practice problems that each treatment group receives will be designed to complete it in one hour.

### 6. Measurement of outcomes

The outcomes are two folds: survey outcomes and experiment outcomes.

For survey outcomes, researchers will analyze participants response right after the survey and make appropriate adjustment in the experiment.

For experiment outcomes, as the confounders have been measured by dividing students into different categories based on their academic performance, it is believed that any differences in outcomes will be caused by the intervention. And as this is a mixed-design study, we could depend on difference in differences groups and participants’ categories for our data analyses. By comparing students’ marks and percentile in four tests, we could measure the outcomes of the treatment in a short and long time. Logistic regression will be used to measure the differences. 

## Discussion
### 1. Validity:

**Internal validity** 

The participants are randomly selected, and the outcomes will be measured using statistic models.

However, one thing might influence the results. It might happen that participants in the treatment groups do not take the tasks on the app seriously. Researchers will use the follow-up survey to get students' opinions and make adjustment in the applicaiton to make sure the chosen participants could get the treatment. 

**External validity**

External validity might be a huge concern. For one, this research only focus on grade 9 high school students considering the costs of the research.For another, the experiment is designed to include high schools from different states the United States, however, as schools are allowed to decide not to accept the invitation letter, it could happen that private schools are less likely to get involved than government and semi-government schools, which might set the sample apart from the target population. If we fail to get permission from five non-government high schools, we would try other recruiting methods to get enough students from private schools, for example, posting recruiting information on the Internet. 


### 2. Heterogeneity of treatment effects

Researchers are aware of treatment effects can be different for students who have different academic performance. This research will use a large sample size and estimate the effect of the three strategies for different high school students among high, moderate and under achievers. 


### 3. Mechanism
The experiment is designed to run experiments with slightly different versions of the treatment. Participants will be randomly assigned to eight groups. By testing every possible combination of strategies, researchers can fully assess the effect of each component in isolation and in combination. After the experiment, the effect of three study stratigies on different students with different academic performance can be meassured.
