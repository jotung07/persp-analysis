## Research Question

Building on previous work (Amos 2017), this study will employ an experimental design to investigate the primary research question:

  * How do alternative subsidy models impact food security outcomes in isolated communities?
      
This experimental design trials one specific type of alternative subsidy model, direct-to-beneficiary (DTB) subsidies. The rationale behind this selection is discussed below. The design approaches the primary research question with respect to the DTB model from several dimensions, which are captured through the secondary research questions:

  * How does a DTB model reduce food insecurity relative to a retailer subsidy program?
      * How do the impacts of a DTB model vary across demographic groups?
      
## Experiment Design

This experiment will leverage a partnership with the Nutrition North program of the Government of Canada to trial a DTB subsidy model in communities currently receiving food subsidy benefits paid directly to retailers. Through this collaboration, the costs of conducting the experiment will be covered by institutional partners with the Government of Canada. This study will serve as an enhancement to Nutrition North's periodic program evaluations. (see Nutrition North Undated) While this will make the study financially feasible, it means the study must be conducted within the framework of the Government of Canada and Nutrition North's policies and priorities. For example, all Government of Canada standard definitions related to food security and isolated communities apply. (see Government of Canada, Undated in Amos 2017). 

### Control and Treatment Community Recruitment

As in previous work, target communities will be those which qualify as isolated (per Government of Canada definitions) and are currently receiving food subsidies under the Nutrition North program. (Nutrition North 2016) Treatment communities will be recruited through a process of local consultation to identify communities which would like to opt-in to a DTB subsidy pilot program. This consultation process will be undertaken with the financial and organizational support of Nutrition North and the Government of Canada. Community leadership will be contacted by the researcher with introduction and community identification facilitated by Nutrition North. 

While this selection process does not allow for extensive randomization, it is an ethical and practical imperative. Due to the importance of food security for communities' health and wellbeing, treatment communities must collectively decide (or via representatives) to opt-in to the pilot program. Treatment respondents will thus need to provide informed consent at the time of recruitment as an individual and again as a community. This is in line with a "do no harm" approach as well as the mandates of project stakeholders (e.g., Government of Canada and Nutrition North, local community governments) to serve community members first and foremost. Control communities will be those in which participants are recruited but the community does not elect to participate in piloting a DTB model. Informed consent for control respondents will be obtained on the individual level through the process of participant recruitment. 

### Randomization and Treatment

Using data gathered during a previous study (Amos 2017) as a baseline, control communities will continue to receive food subsidies delivered directly to retailers, who then pass on savings to customers as part of the Nutrition North program. Treatment communities will be randomly assigned to one of the following treatments:

  * A: 50% of community funding delivered through a DTB model and 50% paid directly to retailers;
  * B: 25% of community funding delivered through a DTB model and 75% paid directly to retailers

The precise proportions may be subject to revision in the course of discussions with stakeholders. There is no provision for a 100% treatment group so as to maintain Nutrition North's partnership with retailers in isolated communities. The difference in differences model (described below) is intended to compensate for this design feature. 

### Using Difference in Differences to Measure Outcomes

Applying the digital methodology from Amos (2017) to monitor food security trends in isolated communities, pre-treatment outcomes will be established for control and treatment groups. Post-treatment outcomes will be recorded using the same methodology. This data collection methodology allows for more granular data on weekly and monthly changes in food security, and respondent data collected at the time of recruitment will allow for estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects on the basis of demographic characteristics. A difference in differences approach will allow trend comparison across characteristics identified either through surveys or at the time of participant recruitment, as well as varying degrees of treatment (A, B, or Control). 

Analysis of experimental data will be guided by the secondary research questions noted above:

  * How does a DTB model reduce food insecurity relative to a retailer subsidy program?
      * Answered with:
          * A comparison of control and treatment communities' reported food security levels;
          * A comparison of communities in treatment A and B, relative to each other and the control group;
  * How do the impacts of a DTB model vary across demographic groups?
      * Answered with:
          * A comparison of control, and treatment (A and B) participants based on demographic characteristics (e.g., socio-economic status, ethnicity)
    
### Preserving External Validity

As a field experiment, this study offers a high degree of external validity. Nevertheless, there may be risks of weakened external validity with respect to other isolated communities. Communities which opt-in to the pilot program may, for example, be economically distinct from communities that do not opt-in. In order to mitigate risks of systematic biases and to validate retailer compliance with Nutrition North requirements, Point-of-Sale (POS) data from retailers in control and treatment communities will be collected. 

Nutrition North already requires retailers to indicate the calculated subsidy contribution towards customers' bill on store-issued receipts. ("How the Subsidy Works" in Nutrition North) Samples of this data are also already collected by Nutrition North as part of regular program audits.(Nutrition North Undated, "Reports") Working with retailers and Nutrition North, this data will be consolidated in order to identify if findings retain external validity in light of prevailing trends in food prices across isolated communities. If, for example, food security monitoring identifies an improvement in food security for a given treatment community, data on trends in food prices can be used to identify if this can be reliably attributed to treatment or if it is more likely tied to an overall decrease in food prices. 

### Preserving Internal Validity

Through a partnership with Nutrition North, the study will be implemented in line with Government of Canada procedures and policies. Project protocols will thus align with the day-to-day operations of the program under study (Nutrition North). This approach risks reproducing existing gaps in the program's implementation, and entails surrendering some environmental control to stakeholders. One and two-sided non-compliance may result from this lack of control (e.g., treatment participants purchase food at subsidized stores in another community or control stores sell stock to treatment retailers). Such occurrences weaken the inferential power of this research design. However, the advantages of the partnership approach, specifically realism and low cost, are judged to outweigh any drawbacks. 

Risks of limited internal validity are also apparent in the selection of treatment of participants. Participants who opt-in to the data collection methodology as outlined by Amos (2017) may differ from individuals who elect not to participate. For details of how risks related to participant selection are mitigated, see Amos (2017). Participant recruitment methods outlined by Amos (2017) will be implemented through existing Government of Canada service points (e.g., Service Canada and provincial/territorial service kiosks, public service provision points such as schools). Recruiters will be trained remotely via webinar by the research team on techniques for identifying participants and ensuring informed consent.  Through these steps, risks to internal validity will be mitigated. However, in order to preserve informed consent (as discussed above), it may not be possible to take steps to ensure no systematic biases exist.

In order to identify the extent to which participant and community selection provide a representative sample, a balance check (Salganik 2017) will be performed on the basis of community and participant characteristics. Community-level characteristics will be compared using a qualitative method by the researcher, while individual-level attributes will be compared based on the collected demographic information at the time of participant recruitment. These findings will allow results to be contextualized and internal validity assessed. 

### Preserving Construct Validity

While the research question focuses on alternative subsidy methods, the only alternative tested here is a DTB model. There are compelling reasons to believe this model is among the most promising. For instance, humanitarian organizations increasingly prioritize cash transfers as a means to promote beneficiary dignity and agency. (e.g., ODI 2015) Moreover, other approaches may not be feasible to test in the context of the Nutrition North program. For example, food security in isolated communities may be mostly a function of larger issues such as poor transportation infrastructure, shifting economic priorities in rural areas, or a legacy of colonization and neglect towards indigenous communities. However, these factors are beyond the financial and conceptual scope of this study. 

## Conclusion

This study will use an experimental design to identify the impact of DTB subsidy models in the context of the Nutrition North program. By collaborating with Nutrition North and the Government of Canada, isolated communities will work with the researcher and Nutrition North to pilot DTB subsidies and report the impact of the trial. Varying impacts of treatment on diverse demographic groups and the sub-treatment groups (A or B) will be identified through a difference in differences analysis. Though sacrificing some internal validity to maintain ethical standards and align with partners' mandates, this study offers high realism at low cost to the researcher.
