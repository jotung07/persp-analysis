2. I find the active competition *Dog Breed Identification* of interest to me. The objective of this competition is to train a deep neural network to identify 120 breeds of dogs using limited training images. Participants will be asked to train a network that return a probability for each dog breed based on an input image. To test each submission, the leaders will check the output of the model and examine the accuracy of the probability output for different breeds of dogs for a given image. I plan to first look through their training image dataset, have a preliminary understanding of the structure of the images. Taking into consideration of the angle, scope, and quality of each dog images, I would have to train the model to first locate the subject(dog) in the picture using a technique that isolate the subject and the background. Then, I would have to use the 10,358 images provided in the training dataset and build a model to learn the different facial structure ratio, body shapes, and sizes while taking implementing a mechanism that would adjust for differences of those key features due to the images themselves based on step 1. I would also have to design a mechanism to keep track of potential mix breed dogs in the dataset. I find it meaningful since a successful-trained network system can potentially provide help to canine rescue groups with identifying dog breeds with greater efficiency and accuracy.

## Problem - 2 Improving a Journal Article
A newly published article *Hyper-selectivity and the remaking of culture: Understanding from the Asian American achievement paradox* from *Asian American Journal of Psychology* by M. Zhou and J. Lee(2017) presents a nuanced perspective on how to understand Asian Americans achievement under the influence of unique Asian cultures. M. Zhou and J. Lee rejects the common stereotype that Asian culture influences Asian Americans and shapes them to have higher education achievement. Instead, they suggests that Asian culture in the United States itself is generated and revised from selective Asian immigration. Namely, the percentage of Asian Americans who immigrated to the U.S., especially Chinese, has forty percentage points higher than average education level in their country of origin and is already twenty percentage higher than the general U.S. population's education level. 

I think that, while this article presents a clear difference of education backgrounds within Asian American population and used it to weaken the hypothesis of Asian cultural influences on success, it does not actually address the question of influence of Asian culture on Asian Americans' success or define it unequivocally. I do not think that using information on people's initial education background upon entering the U.S., and even finding a correlation of that information with Asian Americans current education background, can be used to argue against the hypothesis of culture, since "Asian culture" is not a clearly defined term.

Instead of rejecting the method of this article completely, I propose that this research's results can be better supported as well as carrying more external validity if it includes a human computation section in their research to measure culture. I think that, in addition to their current method, they can use MTurk or other online crowdsourcing websites to conduct a survey, recruiting 1000 or more Asian Americans, and ask them to provide information on their ethnicity, their current citizenship, their country of birth, their education level, their parents' education level and their ratings from 0 - 100 on how much they are influenced by their cultures, and what are the top five ideas that influence them the most. 

The reason that this research is calling for human computation is that computers cannot compute "culture" without intuitively and education backgrounds is not a proper representation of "culture." On the other hand, human beings are continuous contributors to culture and its proper evaluators. It is precisely the human judgement that this research study needs. The self-reported ratings of cultural influence collected from this survey can 1)be used together with this research project, acting as weights to adjust the original results, which solely based on these Asian immigrants previous education background, and 2)stand by itself in attempting to answer the question about Asian American's success and the cultural influence, by not only having a human-computed measurement of cultural influence but also potentially providing a definition of culture that's not based merely on education level. This last part can be achieved by analyzing people's ratings of cultural influence against their education background, as well as comparing between subjects on their top-five ideas that influence them the most using text mining.

Human computation by itself does not seem like an end but rather the means to study accurately and with proper representation an abstract concept that only human, not computer, are capable of possessing, identifying, and passing down to next generation - culture. 

## Problem - 3 Alternative Task to Replace MTurk Task
I used a crowdsourcing website called Zooniverse.org and did an hour of human computation on two projects: 1. SEABIRDWATCH and 2. Treeversity. I finished 50 classifications in total.
