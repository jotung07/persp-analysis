# Markdown

**Markdown** is a plain-text document format that allows a user to add formatting and tags without having to know more complicated languages such as HTML, LaTeX, etc. The syntax is comprised entirely of punctuation characters. For instance, to *emphasize* a word you use asterisks (`*`). It is quick to learn and allows you to easily format documents that don't require extensive code in LaTeX and is also programmatic. That is, Markdown documents are not like Word documents - they are not "What You See Is What You Get". Markdown documents can be rendered into many final document formats (e.g. HTML, PDF). On GitHub, Markdown documents are automatically rendered when you view it on the web site.

The [`rmarkdown` package for R](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) also offers integrated support for generating R-based Markdown documents.
